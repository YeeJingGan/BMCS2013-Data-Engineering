A three-judge panel, led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, handed down the prison sentence to D. Kalaiselvan, 59, after allowing his application to review the death sentence. Judge Tengku Maimun, along with Federal Court Judge Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal Judge Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, ordered the prison sentence to start on July 3, 2011, the date of arrest. Kalaiselvan was found guilty of murdering Nur Rahayu Qomarudin, 16, at the Sungai Masai oil palm plantation between 2.30am and 2.50am on June 18, 2011. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi requested the court to uphold the death penalty as the victim, who was still a child at the time, was brutally murdered, having been beaten, stabbed in the neck, and burned. However, lawyer Datin Kharen Jit Kaur, representing Kalaiselvan, requested that the review application be allowed. Kalaiselvan was sentenced to death by the Johor Bahru High Court on December 26, 2012, and his appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal on March 18, 2014. The Federal Court sitting in Putrajaya on August 25, 2015, also upheld his death sentence. Meanwhile, the same court also set aside the death penalty against Habin Noor Sulaiman, 56, who was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Nur Ain Ashikin Jemedi, 17, in 2010 by stabbing her 19 times and pouring formic acid on her head. She died in the hospital 21 days later. The court replaced the death penalty with a 38-year prison sentence starting from the date of arrest on December 16, 2010. Tetralina requested the court to maintain the death sentence as the victim was pregnant at the time of the incident, which meant Habin Noor took two lives. Lawyer Muhammad Abd Kadir said his client had admitted to the act and surrendered himself to the Ulu Tiram police station after the victim’s family reported the incident. On January 3, 2011, Habin was sentenced to 17 years in prison by the Kota Tinggi Sessions Court after pleading guilty to attempted murder by using a knife, in addition to another 17-year prison sentence for splashing formic acid, seriously injuring the victim. Both offences were committed in Jalan Cemara 2, Kampung Baru Sungai Redan, Kota Tinggi, at 9.15am on December 16, 2010. In 2014, the Court of Appeal amended the charge against Habin Noor to Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder, resulting in the death penalty, which was upheld by the Federal Court on March 22, 2016. Meanwhile, former police corporal Muhammad Faizal Salim, 47, also escaped the death penalty and was sentenced to 40 years in prison with 12 lashes for murdering his pregnant girlfriend Norzielawati Akmar Afandi, 35. The court ordered Faizal to serve his sentence starting from the date of arrest on April 13, 2015. He was charged with murdering the woman at Hutan Bandar Bukit Cantik, Mersing, between 11pm on April 12, 2015, and 12.30am on April 13, 2015. Tetralina requested that the death penalty be upheld as the autopsy report revealed that the cause of Norzielawati’s death was a severe blow with a blunt object to the head, and the deceased also had 47 other injuries on her body, such as bruises, cuts and abrasions. “The baby in her womb was also six months old, so the applicant had killed two lives, and witnesses also heard the victim pleading not to be beaten, but the applicant ignored her,” she said. Faizal’s lawyer Iskandar Shah Ibrahim said his client had intended to take the victim for medical treatment. On May 21, 2018, the Court of Appeal upheld Faizal’s conviction and death sentence, and the Federal Court also maintained this decision. — Bernama "

Meanwhile, Vijay Ratnam requested the court to set aside the death sentence and allow a review, arguing that his client deeply regrets his actions and is now suffering from several diseases, including antisocial personality disorder, hypertension, and chronic Hepatitis C. On June 5, 2015, the High Court in Melaka sentenced Azman to death after finding him guilty of murdering Muhammad Firdaus Mohd Dan, aged six, at an oil palm plantation in Kampung Solok Pinang Gadek, Alor Gajah, Melaka, between 10.30am and 2.15pm on October 10, 2011.

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said the states include Perak, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, Terengganu, and Labuan. The raids led to the arrests of 11 individuals aged between 38 and 56, including the organisation’s founders, directors, and volunteers. “Initial investigations revealed that the scam syndicate, operating under the guise of Pertubuhan Amal Kita Kinta, Perak, had been active since early last year, promising returns of either one kampung chicken or RM13 per month for every RM250 invested. “Investors deposited funds into the organisation’s bank account. However, from September 2023 onwards, they stopped receiving the promised returns. “A total of 85 police reports on the case were received nationwide,” he said at a press conference today. The police seized 13 luxury vehicles, 13 gold chains, two gold rings, 20 smartphones, 17 laptops, eight chequebooks, 37 bank cards, 2,143 sheep, and numerous documents suspected to be related to the scam. They also froze the organisation’s 34 bank and unit trust accounts, totalling RM6.5 million, under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing, and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001. Ramli said the case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. On a separate note, he advised the public to exercise caution when making donations, especially if it involved unregistered individuals or organisations. The public’s tendency to sympathise and offer help to individuals facing adversity creates opportunities for unscrupulous individuals to exploit these sentiments for financial gain under the guise of charity. “The public must ensure that their donations are made only to registered organisations that undergo audit processes. They also need to know how the donations are used. “Bank accounts of organisations collecting donations must also undergo audits to ensure that the funds received are directed to the intended parties,” Ramli emphasised. He was commenting on the recent arrests related to the misappropriation of donations. Yesterday, a social media influencer couple was remanded for four days to assist in an investigation into the alleged misappropriation of donations. A source from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission disclosed that the couple has been suspected of misappropriating public donations, estimated at RM3 million, since 2020.

A three-judge panel comprising Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, Federal Court judges Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, allowed V. Raja’s review application under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. Justice Tengku Maimun ordered the prison sentence on Raja to begin from the date of his arrest on May 23, 2010, and also imposed 12 strokes of caning. Raja, 35, was found guilty by the High Court in 2012 for killing M. Kanan, 42, at a flood retention pond in Lorong Air Jernih, Setapak, Kuala Lumpur, between 1am and 2am on August 24, 2009. He failed in his appeals to overturn his conviction and death sentence at the Court of Appeal in 2013 and Federal Court in 2015. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Zulkpli Abdullah urged the court to uphold the death sentence, citing the extremely brutal nature of the murder and its apparent lack of motive based on the facts of the case. He said on the night of the murder, Raja and a group of his friends went in a van to the location of the deceased. The deceased, who was a transgender woman and worked as a prostitute, was forced to enter the van and have sexual intercourse with Raja, who later stabbed her with a knife. Raja’s lawyer T. Vijayandran had earlier pleaded for the court to give his client a chance to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment. Meanwhile, the same panel commuted the death sentence imposed on Indonesian Edi Eko Saputro to 36 years in jail for murdering his lover after allowing his review application under the same Act. Justice Tengku Maimun also sentenced Edi Eko, 39, to 12 strokes of the cane and his jail term to start from the date of his arrest on July 31, 2011. Edi, a labourer, was sentenced to death by the High Court in 2012 for killing Nestriana, also an Indonesian, at a house in Kampung Rumah Sepuluh, Plentong, Masai, Johor, at 10.20am on July 31, 2011. His appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2014 and by the Federal Court the following year. DPP Mohd Fairuz Johari requested the court to uphold the death sentence, saying that the deceased was struck three times on the head with a bag containing a large rock. However, Edi’s lawyer Choong Kak Sen appealed for it to be commuted to life imprisonment, saying it was “a crime of passion”. He added that his client and the deceased were lovers, and he had struck her after suspecting her of having an affair with another man. — Bernama "

Judge Hamidah Mohamed Deril sentenced Azwan Samsudin, 43, who admitted to transferring RM1,367,530.77 belonging to Helen Tan Boon See, 63, into a bank account under his company AW Builders and Renovation Sdn Bhd. The offence was committed at a premise in Sentul on April 19, and he was charged under Section 424 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine, or both. Subsequently, Azwan and his father-in-law Muhamad Dzulhasymi Ishak, 48, were each sentenced to six months in prison after pleading guilty to the same offence involving RM146,090 belonging to Saw Teong Soon, 48. They transferred the money into the same bank account at 11:18am on January 14 and were charged under the same Act and section. Hamidah ordered both Azwan’s prison sentences to run concurrently from the date of arrest on June 28, while Dzulhasymi was also ordered to begin his prison sentence on the same date. The case was handled by deputy public prosecutor Akmalzatul Mohamed Nawi, while both accused were unrepresented.

Azrul ordered the sentence to begin immediately. Deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Amir Haniff Ahijman appeared for the prosecution. According to the facts of the case, the victim had come across the job offer on the Facebook page of ‘pulseplacex’. She then opened an account on a website, where her task was to book hotels through ‘pulseplacex’, and was required to top up her account if the balance was insufficient. She completed the first task and received a return on her money, which led her to believe the job was legitimate. Consequently, she made several transfers into the accused’s bank account between January and April. She was later contacted by ‘pulseplacex,’ informing her that her money could not be returned because the authorities were investigating them. They also demanded more than RM2 million from the victim to avoid being arrested. Both the accused were later apprehended and they could not explain the transfers into Azwan’s company bank account. — Bernama "

In a judicial review application filed on April 1, Najib said an “addendum order” issued by the former king had accompanied a pardons board’s decision in February to halve his 12-year jail sentence for graft in the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal. Najib sought for the court to compel the government to reply to or confirm the existence of the royal order, which he said would entitle him to serve the remainder of his term under house arrest, and to execute the order if it existed. In a copy of the judgment released to the media today, the High Court found there was no arguable case warranting a full hearing of Najib’s application. Judge Amarjeet Singh described affidavits filed by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and another high-ranking politician from Najib’s party saying they had seen a copy of the royal order as hearsay, and said the government had no legal duty to respond to the application. Najib planned to appeal the decision, his lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters. “In terms of ethics, the government should have answered,” he said. The pardons board that halved Najib’s term was chaired by former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, whose five-year reign as king ended in January. Najib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state fund 1MDB. The verdict was upheld by the Federal Court in 2022. Malaysian and United States investigators estimate US$4.5 billion (RM21.2 billion) was stolen from 1MDB and more than US$1 billion channelled to accounts linked to Najib. The pardons board in February said Najib was expected to be released in August 2028, six years after he began serving his sentence. It also reduced fines imposed on the ex-Prime Minister, sparking uproar among Malaysians. Najib, who is also considering filing a new petition for a full pardon, remains on trial for corruption in several other 1MDB-linked cases. — Reuters "

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said all the suspects were locals, aged between 31 and 54. The police received a report on June 24 from a 42-year-old man claiming that his employer’s rented house in Taman Ehsan, Kepong, had been broken into, with the suspects making off with three cars, namely an Audi R8, a Porsche 718 Cayman, and a Suzuki Swift. “At the time of the incident, the complainant’s employer was said to be in China, and losses were estimated to be around RM700,000,” he told a press conference at the Selangor contingent police headquarters today. Based on the information received, the police conducted a series of raids in Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, and Perak, resulting in the arrest of all the suspects, including the group’s mastermind. Initial investigations found that the mastermind, aged 38, had prior records involving drug and criminal offences. “The modus operandi of the group, which has been active for the past year, was to identify houses with luxury vehicles before breaking in and stealing the vehicles. In addition to being sold, these vehicles were used in other criminal activities,” Hussein said. Following the arrests, the police seized four luxury vehicles, including the three stolen in the Kepong incident, as well as various tools used for criminal activities.

In a unanimous decision reached by a panel of three judges led by Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, the court dismissed the final appeal by Hazmi Majid, 42, to set aside his conviction and sentence. “The conviction and (death) sentence is safe. This court upholds the sentence as decided by the Court of Appeal and the High Court,” said Judge Rhodzariah, sitting with Datuk Abu Bakar Jais and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera. Earlier, lawyer T. Vijayandran, representing Hazmi, submitted that his client was unaware of his action as he was under the influence of drugs and requested the death sentence to be set aside and replaced with a 30-year imprisonment. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi said the plea of being under the influence of drugs should dismissed as Hazmi attempted to dispose of evidence by washing a towel to remove blood, showing that he was conscious when the incident happened. According to Tetralina, the case meets the requirement of “the rarest of rare cases’ which justifies the death penalty being upheld. “The victim was sent by her mother to the babysitter’s house at 6.45am on the day of the incident, and the child died at 1.30pm. She only weighs 8.26kg, her teeth have not yet grown, and the severe haemorrhaging of the brain means that her chances of survival are slim,” she said. Based on the prosecution evidence, the appellant never offered to help his wife, who was the child’s babysitter, but on that day, he volunteered to bathe the victim. Hazmi was found guilty of killing and causing the death of Nur Muazara Ulfa Mohammad Zainal, or Zara, in a unit at Pangsapuri Sri Cempaka, Bandar Baru Bangi, between 10.30am and 1.30pm on November 7, 2018. The accused is charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which provides for the death penalty, upon conviction. In March last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the death sentence handed down on Hazmi by the Shah Alam High Court on August 20, 2021. In 2019, Hazmi was also sentenced to 13 years in prison and 12 strokes of the cane by the Shah Alam High Court on two counts of sexually abusing the child. He had pleaded guilty to inserting his finger into the 11-month-old infant’s private parts. It was reported that the infant died two days after being in critical condition at Serdang Hospital, believed to be due to physical and sexual abuse by her babysitter’s husband. — Bernama "

In our view, this is an exceptional case with exceptional facts,” said Justice Harmindar. He said the deceased (Chee Gaik Yap) had suffered exceptional violence at Shahril’s hands, as the 25-year-old was abducted, sodomised, raped, and killed by Shahril. The crime caused public uproar and shock, as the incident occurred in broad daylight. “We are constrained to dismiss Shahril’s application, and the death sentence is upheld,” said Justice Harmindar.

Earlier, Shahril’s lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin asked the court to commute the death sentence imposed on his client to life imprisonment. He conveyed Shahril’s remorse and appealed to the court for a chance at redemption, citing his client’s active participation in prison rehabilitation programmes as a testament to his commitment to repent.

In the court’s decision, Justice Tengku Maimun said the death sentence imposed on the accused for the kidnapping and murder offences is set aside and substituted with 40 years’ jail to run concurrently from the date of his arrest on September 15, 2008. Justice Tengku Maimun, who presided with Federal Court judges Datuk Zabariah Mohd Yusof and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, also ordered Teh to be given 17 strokes of the rotan.

His appeals to the Court of Appeal and Federal Court were dismissed on April 22, 2013, and January 29, 2015, respectively. Shawal’s counsel Bustaman Menon Abdul Hamid Menon pleaded for leniency to commute the accused’s death sentence to a prison sentence of between 33 years and 35 years. He submitted that although it was a tragic case involving a small boy who was beaten over three days, Shawal’s act did not stem from “a heart of evil” or that he had intended to kill the boy. Abdul Hamid claimed that the accused, who had lost his job and was using drugs at the time, beat the child to discipline him. Deputy public prosecutor Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir objected to Shawal’s application and asked the court to uphold the death sentence imposed on him. She said the accused had repeatedly hit his stepson with his hand, a clothes hanger, feather duster, and a hammer and it was an act of blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life. According to the facts of the case, Shawal got angry and assaulted the child by hand, a hammer, a clothes hanger, and a feather duster and also kicked him when the boy did not respond to his questions. His wife tried to stop him but was warned that she would face the same consequences. The boy’s mother testified that the accused told her he had used a lighter to burn the child’s private parts.

A three-judge panel, chaired by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail alongside Mohamed Zaini Mazlan and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, announced the date today after concluding a three-day hearing that began Monday. “The court will deliver its verdict on July 23 at 9am,” Hadhariah said. The six former students are Muhammad Akmal Zuhairi Azmal, Muhammad Azamuddin Mad Sofi, Muhammad Najib Mohd Razi, Muhammad Afif Najmudin Azahat, Mohamad Shobirin Sabri, and Abdoul Hakeem Mohd Ali. The first five defendants were charged with murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which carries a mandatory death sentence upon conviction, while Abdoul Hakeem was charged with abetting the murder under Section 109 of the Penal Code, which carries the same penalty. The Kuala Lumpur High Court found the six defendants guilty of intentionally causing injury to Zulfarhan without intent to kill, under Section 304(a) of the Penal Code, which carries a prison sentence of up to 30 years and a fine, if the act is committed with intent to cause death. The defendants were charged with committing the act in a room at the Asrama Jebat block, UPNM, between 4.45am and 5.45am on May 22, 2017. Zulfarhan died at Serdang Hospital on June 1, 2017. On July 23, the court will deliver the verdict on the appeal of 12 more former UPNM students who were found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison for intentionally causing injury to Zulfarhan to coerce a confession that he stole a laptop. The former students were charged under Section 330 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum prison sentence of seven years and a fine, upon conviction. They are Mohd Hafiz Fauzan Ismail, Mohamad Lukhmanul Hakim Mohd Zain, Ahmad Shafwan Berdal, Muhammad Amirul Asraff Mala, Luqman Hakim Shamsuri Agus, Muhammad Sufi Mohd Mustapha, Noriznan Izzairi Noor Azhar, Muhamad Ashraf Abdullah, Muhammad Danial Firdaus Azmir, Muhammad Hasif Ismail, Muhammad Adib Iman Fuad Ady Sani and Mohamad Syazwan Musa. The defendants, now aged 28, were charged with committing the offence in two rooms at the Asrama Jebat block, UPNM, between May 21 and 22, 2017. Earlier, Abdoul Hakeem’s lawyer, Datuk Mohd Zamri Mohd Idrus, argued Zulfarhan had several opportunities to seek medical treatment for his injuries and that no one had prevented him from doing so. “The incident took place in a UPNM room, not in a remote jungle, and many people were around. How come not a single phone call was made to his parents? This is a puzzling question for the lawyers,” he said. “The investigating officer was focused on solely blaming all the defendants. Who will ensure justice for these individuals?” he added. In response to this argument, judge Zaini asked the lawyer: “Are you shifting the blame onto the victim now?” Zamri submitted that many factors contributed to the victim’s death, but to place all the blame on the appellants was not fair. In reply to Zamri’s submission, deputy public prosecutor K. Mangai said there was evidence the appellants did not want to take Zulfarhan to the hospital because they did not want to tarnish their names. “They (appellants) kept him in another room and there was no evidence his phone was with him. “He was in terrible condition, he didn’t go to the roll call and prep class because he was sick, and his body was covered with boils (from the scalding),” she said. Mangai further submitted there was a piece of evidence where the e-hailing driver who brought Zulfarhan to the clinic had to clean the backseat of his car because there was blood and mucous where the victim was sitting. “If the e-hailing driver could see the condition of the deceased, why couldn’t the respondents?” she questioned. — Bernama "

But so far, there is no connection with secret societies,” Rusdi said. Two of the six suspects were also investigated under Section 148 of the Penal Code for rioting in a public place using offensive weapons. A closed circuit camera (CCTV) footage went viral on May 9, showing four people on motorcycles throwing petrol bombs in front of the entertainment centre located on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng.

Judge K. Muniandy made the decision after allowing the prosecution’s application to review the Sessions Court’s decision to reject the gag order. In his judgment, Muniandy said it is best if the trial judge hears the case in accordance with the rule of law and procedure without heeding any statement, comment or criticism, which may be levelled in the entirety against the case. “The legal principles cited pertains to the sanctity of the trial, which has to be preserved at all costs. As the charge signifies, which is pursuant to Section 500 read with Section 499 of the Penal Code, its rationale is to prevent any imputation which will harm the reputation of the king,” the judge said. The judge said unlike a civil case, where the aggrieved party is in a position to apply for an injunction to prevent and restrain the offender from repeating the defamatory statement, such an avenue is not available to the prosecution in a criminal proceeding, as once the matter reaches the court, the court takes over conduct of the case to ensure justice is not compromised for the prosecution or the accused. “The institution of a contempt proceeding or the like is a matter to be taken care of eventually when the need arises. Thus, until then, the freshness of issues to be ventilated at the trial as well as sanctity of the trial has to be preserved by the court,” he said.

Judge Mohd Zul Zakiqudin Zulkifli meted out the punishment to the 44-year-old today, after he pleaded guilty to all five charges. The court sentenced the accused to 10 years in prison for one count of rape; eight years in prison each for the other three counts of rape, with 40 strokes of the cane; another two years in prison and two years of police supervision for a sexual assault offence. The judge ordered all prison terms to run separately and ordered the accused to receive a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane under the Criminal Procedure Code. Judge Zakiqudin said the court meted out the sentence after taking into account the repeated offences, the accused’s relationship with the victim and the accused’s guilty plea, which saved the court time. According to the charge sheet, the man was accused raping the then-14-year-old victim four times, in January, February, March, and May last year, in two separate locations, namely at a restaurant and a house in Losong. The father of two was charged under Section 376 (3) of the Penal Code, which provides for a prison sentence of up to 30 years and not less than 10 strokes of the cane. He is also accused of committing physical and sexual assault against the same victim in the same house on December last year, and the charge is framed under Section 14(a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017. Deputy public prosecutor Intan Nor Hilwani Mat Rifin pressed for an appropriate sentence which befits the seriousness of the crimes and serves as a lesson as sexual offences are now becoming more prevalent. The accused, who was unrepresented, expressed remorse for his actions and pleaded for leniency on the grounds that he wanted to look after his elderly mother. — Bernama "

A panel of three judges, led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, meted out the sentence against Faizol Aznan Muhamad, 43, and Mohd Riduan Ismail, 35, after the court unanimously replaced the conviction under Section 302 of the Penal Code for the offence of murder, to Section 304 (a) of the same law. “Therefore, the sentence under Section 302 of the Penal Code is set aside, and replaced with a 12-year prison sentence, starting from the date of arrest,” she said. The other judges on the bench were Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Mohamed Zaini Mazlan. Faizol and Riduan were arrested in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Earlier, lawyer Ghazali Ismail, representing the two appellants, informed the court that the defence had submitted a representation to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to amend the charges against the clients from Section 302 of the Penal Code to Section 304 (a) of the same law, and the AGC agreed to it. “The 12-year prison sentence, starting from the date of arrest, was also agreed upon by both parties,” he said. Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Amril Johari also confirmed the matter. The charge, framed under Section 304 (a), was read to Faizol and Riduan, and they later pleaded guilty to the charge. The two were accused of causing the death of Razak Abdullah, 50, also a turtle egg collector, at Pantai Geliga, in front of SK Sri Geliga Chukai, Kemaman, at around 7am on June 3, 2016. The charge was framed under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 30 years and is liable to a fine. Based on the facts of the case, Faizol had an argument with a man, another turtle egg collector, regarding the division of the turtles’ egg-laying area on the beach. The victim, who was at the scene of the incident, tried to calm both parties, which angered Faizol, who then repeatedly hit the victim in the face with a stick. The second accused, Riduan, intervened by hitting the victim in the face with a helmet. On August 9, 2021, the Kuala Terengganu High Court sentenced Faizol and Riduan to death after finding that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubt against the prosecution’s case at the end of the defence case. — Bernama "

Deputy public prosecutor Nurilya Ellyna Nor Azmal informed the Sessions Court that Sang Kelembai, the pseudonym of Datuk Abd Zarin Mohd Yasin, 72, had submitted the representation to the Kuala Lumpur Prosecution Unit. “The representation has been dismissed, and the matter has been communicated to the defence via email,” she said.

Hamzah Osman’s application for a review of his death sentence under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023 was allowed by a three-member panel today, comprising Federal Court judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal, Datuk Nordin Hassan, and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Harmindar also ordered Hamzah to be given 12 strokes of the cane and for the sentence to run from the date of his arrest on August 21, 2008. Hamzah, now 33, was initially found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court in 2014, but in 2017, the Federal Court ordered a retrial. Then, in 2018, the Ipoh High Court found the accused guilty and sentenced him to death for murdering Norazlida Iden, 31, in Room 202, Suria Beach Resort, Teluk Nipah, Pulau Pangkor, Perak, at 1am on August 18, 2008. He further lost his appeals in the Court of Appeal and Federal court in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir objected to Hamzah’s application to commute his death sentence on the grounds that the deceased was five months pregnant at the time and, therefore, two lives were lost. The accused’s lawyer Ali Munawar Razak appealed for his client to be given a second chance, as Hamzah was 18 years old at the time and has expressed remorse for his actions. According to the case facts, the accused, who was employed by the deceased as a maintenance worker and housekeeper, was said to have disciplinary problems and was often reprimanded by the deceased before he was eventually terminated. However, the deceased allowed him to stay at the resort while looking for a new job. On the day of the incident, the deceased’s husband received news of her death in the room. Later, he found that her belongings, including money, jewellery, a laptop, cell phones, and a digital camera, were missing. A post-mortem revealed that multiple blows from a blunt and hard object inflicted the injuries to the deceased’s head. Police arrested Hamzah and two other men three days later and seized the deceased’s stolen jewellery and handphones from him. Hamzah then led police to recover seven pieces of jewellery from a goldsmith shop, where he had sold them on August 19, 2008, for RM1,500. — Bernama "

Judge Datuk Noorin Badaruddin dismissed her appeal to set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Sessions Court in May last year. “The court finds no reason to tamper with the findings of the Sessions Court judge. Therefore, the appellant’s conviction and sentence are safe and upheld. The appellant’s appeal is dismissed,” said the judge. On May 3, 2023, Sessions Court Judge Izralizam Sanusi sentenced Siti Bainun to 12 years in prison after finding her guilty on two charges of neglecting and abusing Bella, 13, and ordered her to start serving the sentence immediately after rejecting her application for a stay of execution. Siti Bainun was sent to Kajang Prison to serve her prison sentence. Judge Noorin also rejected the application by the accused’s lawyer Haijan Omar for a stay of the sentence pending her appeal of today’s verdict filed at the Court of Appeal. In her judgment, she said the court found 18 injuries and scars on the victim’s body, proven by all the medical witnesses that they were not accidental or self-inflicted (by Bella). “The court is satisfied that the Sessions Court judge conducted a thorough assessment of the prosecution witnesses, including eyewitness Yasmin Nahar Mahmood (a former resident of Rumah Bonda), who testified as the fifth prosecution witness (PW5), supported by expert medical witnesses who examined the victim. “The court also finds that the Sessions Court judge did not err in his findings in concluding that, based on all the evidence presented, the appellant was responsible for the physical and emotional injuries inflicted on the victim,” Judge Noorin said. Besides the testimony of PW5, the testimony of PW8, Suhana Zam (a close friend of Siti Bainun), was also supported by medical evidence consistently indicating the injuries sustained by the victim were not accidental. Therefore, the court finds it difficult to conclude that both witnesses fabricated their stories against the appellant. She said the victim is a special-needs child, and the testimony of the prosecution witnesses as a whole completes the prosecution’s narrative that the victim was neglected and abused, resulting in physical and emotional injuries. The court has found the appellant’s defence, claiming that the victim suffered only one scalding, to be inconsistent with the narrative and evidence presented by the prosecution. Judge Noorin said that expert witnesses stated that examinations of the victim revealed that the injuries had occurred at different times because some of them had healed. The testimony provided by these expert witnesses was consistent, whereas the appellant’s and defense witnesses’ accounts of a single hot water spillage was contradictory. “The court found that nearly all the reasons given by the appellant in her petition were repetitions of issues raised during the Sessions Court trial. “The court finds that the issues raised by the appellant and her defense could not raise reasonable doubt about the essence of the charges against her,” the judge said. Regarding the charges, Judge Noorin said that based on the deposition notes, the court found no evidence or circumstances indicating the appellant was confused about the charges against her, rendering her unable to defend herself. The court found that the appellant was adequately notified about the charges from the outset and comprehended the nature of the case concerning how the offenses were committed. The testimonies presented and the extensive cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses indicated that the appellant was aware, not confused, and understood that the charges against her involved neglect and abuse that she had committed, both physically and emotionally, against the victim. “The court is also satisfied that via the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, the appellant was not prejudiced by the charges presented, whether before or after they were amended by the Sessions Court judge,” Judge Noorin said. According to the charges, Siti Bainun is accused of neglecting and abusing the teenage girl with Down’s syndrome, causing her to suffer physical and emotional injuries at a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju between February and June 2021. Both charges were framed under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment or a fine of RM50,000 or both. The court also ordered the accused to sign a good behaviour bond for five years with a surety and a bond of RM5,000, and to perform 200 hours of community service to be completed within six months after serving the prison sentence. Deputy public prosecutors Zahida Zakaria and Analia Kamaruddin handled the case, while Siti Bainun’s counsel Haijan was assisted by lawyers Nur A’minahtul Mardiah Md Noor and Nurul Hafidzah Hassan. Siti Bainun appeared in court wearing a white robe and a light green headscarf. Speaking to the press after the proceedings, lawyer Datuk Khairul Anwar Rahmat, who was appointed as an observer by the Regent of Johor Tunku Mahkota Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, said Bella is still traumatised despite her injuries having healed. He said that based on clinical assessments, Bella is currently 17 years old, and they have contacted the National Registration Department through the Social Welfare Department to obtain updates on her identification card status. — Bernama "

A three-member panel of judges chaired by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin unanimously replaced the death sentence by the Shah Alam High Court on Sobri Abdul Wahab with the jail term. Hadhariah said the Shah Alam High Court did not err in its decision to convict the 46-year-old, and there was no merit in the accused’s appeal and plea of insanity at the time of the incident. “Such a claim could not be proven. Therefore, the conviction is upheld, but the death sentence is replaced with a jail term,” she said. Hadhariah ordered Sobri to serve the jail sentence from the date of his arrest on March 10, 2018. On December 31, 2021, the Shah Alam High Court sentenced the accused to death after finding him guilty after he was charged with murdering school canteen helper Gusnima, 38, at her rented apartment in Section U8, Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, between 6pm and 8pm on March 10, 2018. The victim, from Medan, Indonesia, was found dead with 14 stabs to her neck, five to the body, four in the stomach, three in the chest, and two to the skull. Earlier, lawyer K.A Ramu, representing Sobri, pleaded that his client was insane and was not under medication at the time of the incident, but Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Siew Wee objected to the plea, claiming the accused was not medically insane because he behaved normally. During the proceeding, the accused was also represented by Khairul Naim Rafidi and Farida Mohammad. Following the amendment to Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court can sentence an accused to not less than 30 years and not more than 40 years if the death penalty is not imposed, and a male convict shall also be punished with whipping of not less 12 strokes of the rotan. — Bernama "

The charge was framed under Section 395/397 of the Penal Code and read together with Section 34, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and whipping upon conviction. Earlier, lawyer Zainal Omar, who represented Azizi, requested that his client be given a lighter sentence, as he has two young children and a 76-year-old mother. However, deputy public prosecutor Illya Syaheedah Mohd Razif pressed for just punishment to serve as a lesson to the accused as the incident involved an elderly victim. Based on the case facts, while the victim was in the living room of the house and looking after her granddaughter, the accused and his two accomplices entered the victim’s house armed with a shovel and a stick. The trio asked the elderly woman to hand over money and valuables, as well as threatening to hit the woman’s husband with the shovel if she refused to cooperate. The victim handed over the money and the two mobile phones to the accused in fear before they left the victim’s house with the items. — Bernama "

Justice Tengku Maimun, who delivered the court’s decision, set aside the death sentence and substituted it with a 30-year jail term.

Shahrul, 51, was found guilty by the High Court in Shah Alam in 2010 for killing his colleague, Nurul Hazira Bharum, 26. He committed the crime after learning that she was going to marry another man. The offence was committed at his rented house in Kampung Gombak, Kuang, Rawang, Selangor, between 9am and 10am on October 7, 2008. His appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal and Federal Court in 2012 and 2015, respectively. In his defence, the accused told the High Court that he and Nurul Hazira, a clerk, had planned to commit suicide by drinking poison ‘like Romeo and Juliet,’ claiming that Nurul Hazira forced him to drink the poison first causing him to pass out. Shahrul said that when he woke up, Nurul Hazira was already dead, and he ran to a neighbour’s house for help. He claimed that Nurul Hazira had confided in him, saying she was not in love with the man who proposed to her and instead asked Shahrul to marry her.

The duo, who have been incarcerated in prison for 18 years and three months, were ordered to serve jail sentences from the date of their arrest on January 22, 2006. The court earlier rejected deputy public prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi’s request to uphold the death sentence on the two former policemen, as she said their case falls under the rarest of the rare category. Tetralina told the court that the deceased, Yusrizal Yusuf, 38, was under full control of the two men at all times, from the time of his arrest until his death. She said Yusrizal was shot “execution style” when he was brought to an open space field at KM22, Kuala Lumpur-Kuala Selangor-Batu Arang road, in Gombak, Selangor. The victim was handcuffed and was told to kneel down, and Saiful fired three shots to the head at close range while Ailias stood in front of the victim. However, lawyer Muhammad Fadhli Sutris, representing Ailias and Saiful Azlan, urged the court to give his clients a second chance, as Ailias is suffering from a chronic disease and is wheel-chair bound while Saiful had been admitted to ICU several times. He said Ailias, who had served the Royal Malaysia Police since 1976, and Saiful, who had worked with the police force since 1982, regretted what they had done and asked for mercy from the court as they wanted to meet their families. Ailias, 70, a former corporal and Saiful Azlan, 60, a former lance corporal, were sentenced to death by the Shah Alam High Court in 2011 for killing Yusrizal at Ladang Caledonia KM22 between 10.00pm and 11.30pm on January 13, 2006.

The 45-year-old pleaded not guilty after the charge was read before Judge Rasidah Roslee. He is accused of making seditious remarks on his Facebook account under the name ‘Che GuBard’ at 6.30pm on April 26 at Mutiara Villa Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur. The charge is framed under Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 (Act 15), which provides a maximum fine of RM5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both if found guilty. Deputy public prosecutors Datuk Masri Mohd Daud, Abdul Ghafar Ab Latif, Abdul Malik Ayob, and Nadia Mohd Izhar appeared for the prosecution, while Badrul Hisham was represented by Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali. Also present was Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim to hold a watching brief. Earlier, Masri offered bail of RM20,000 in one surety in addition to applying for a gag order so both parties would not issue any comments or public statements on any social media platform until the disposal of the case. However, Rafique requested a lower bail on the grounds that his client supports his wife and four children, including one with disabilities, and only the client’s wife is currently working. He added that the RM20,000 bail offered by the prosecution is high compared with the RM5,000 penalty provided under the Sedition Act. “The client has also been accused of the same offence at the Kuala Lumpur Section Court with bail set at RM10,000 in one surety. “The gag order applied by the prosecution is not specific and is unconstitutional as, according to Article 10, Malaysians have the freedom to discuss matters openly according to the law,” said the lawyer. The accused was then allowed bail of RM10,000 in one surety, and the court rejected the prosecution’s gag order. The court also set June 24 for re-mention. Yesterday, Badrul Hisham was charged in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with two counts of inciting and issuing defamatory remarks that would tarnish the good name of His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, the King of Malaysia.

However, the court substituted the death sentence imposed on Azhud to 30 years’ jail with 12 strokes of the rotan. In affirming the accused’s conviction for the murder offence, Justice Hadhariah said circumstantial evidence showed that it was Azhud who murdered Ahmad Azam Ahmad.

The friend said the accused had said “I am angry with him for a long time. I am upset. In his testimony from the dock, Azhud claimed he had no intention of murdering his friend after both were involved in a fight.

However, the 45-year-old, commonly known as Chegu Bard, pleaded not guilty after the two charges were read before Judge Siti Aminah Ghazali. According to the first charge, he is alleged to have made seditious remarks on his Facebook page at Taman Bukit Cheras at 12.15pm on April 6. The charge is framed under Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 and punishable under the same law, which provides a maximum fine of RM5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both if convicted. Badrul is also alleged to have made defamatory remarks and had reason to believe the statements would tarnish the King’s good name. The offence was allegedly committed at the Office of the Comptroller of Royal Household, Istana Negara, at 6pm on January 22. The charge is framed under Section 500 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment or a fine or both upon conviction. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Syed Faisal Syed Amir offered bail of RM20,000 in one surety for each charge as the offence committed involving the King. “The prosecution is also requesting a gag order so that both parties do not issue any comments or public statements on any social media platform until the disposal of the case. “This is necessary to ensure that the course of the case is not interrupted, in addition to maintaining public order and avoiding provocative comments that will worsen the situation,” he said. Lawyer Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali, who represented the accused, appealed for a lower bail on the grounds that his client supports his wife and four children. He said the RM20,000 bail offered by the prosecution is relatively high compared to the punishment provided under the Sedition Act (RM5,000). “We also object to the gag order because it is unconstitutional as the people need to be given freedom of speech. The prosecution also does not specify the gag order,” said the lawyer. The court allowed the accused to be bailed at RM10,000 in one surety for each charge and rejected the gag order. The court set May 27 for re-mention. Meanwhile, during a press conference in the court lobby after the proceedings, Badrul said he will also be charged at the Johor Bahru Sessions Court tomorrow (April 30) under the Sedition Act 1948 over his Facebook post regarding the purported opening of a casino in Forest City in Johor. — Bernama   "

However, the panel allowed Khairul Izani’s appeal to set aside the death sentence and replace it with a prison sentence.

The offence was committed at a house at Jalan Bukit Indah 5, Taman Bukit Indah, Ampang, Selangor at 11am on November 8, 2018. Zaidi, when delivering the court’s decision, said Khairul failed to show that the High Court judge had erred in his finding when dismissing his defence of mental insanity. On the contrary, there was evidence proving that Khairul was sane during the incident as testified by his wife that her husband stopped beating the child after seeing the boy’s head bleeding and immediately took the deceased to a clinic for treatment. He said the accused’s act of lying to the doctor that the boy was injured due to a fall in the bathroom was consistent with the behaviour of a sane person. “We found that the trial judge cannot be said to be wrong in his finding that the accused’s actions in beating the deceased happened because of his hot temper and not because he was mentally unsound,” Zaidi said. Based on the facts of the case, Khairul’s wife saw her husband beating the child repeatedly, stepping on him, strangling the neck, and banging his head against the wall until the boy’s head bled. The woman did not succeed in stopping her husband from beating the child because she was heavily pregnant and also because the accused was a hot-tempered person.

A three-member panel of judges comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin dismissed his appeal for a lower jail sentence. In delivering the court’s decision today, Justice Hadhariahsaid the man’s appeal did not have any merit. Earlier in the proceedings, she said sexual offences against children were rampant. The court also upheld the 27 strokes of caning meted out by the High Court on the 43-year-old man. Justice Hadhariah said the court declined to reduce the number of strokes imposed on the man, although the law states that a convict may be whipped a maximum of 24 times. She added that the court would leave it to prison authorities. The man committed the offences on the girls, then aged 14 and 11, at a convenience store and car park of a religious school in Kampar, Perak, between June 16 and June 17, 2020. He pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexually assaulting the older sister, and the Sessions Court sentenced him to 10 years each, with the sentences to run concurrently. He was also ordered to be given 18 strokes of caning. The man was also sentenced to 10 years in jail for three counts of committing sexual assault on the younger sister. He was ordered to be given another nine strokes of the cane, with the sentences to run concurrently. The Sessions Court ordered for the 10-year jail term to commence after the man had completed serving the 10-year jail for the offences against the older sister. He was ordered to serve the sentence from the date of his arrest on June 20, 2020. On July 21 last year, the High Court reduced the jail sentence of one of the charges from 10 years and three strokes of the cane to three years and no caning. However, the High Court judge said it would not make any difference as the jail sentences were to run concurrently. Lawyer Mohamad Zaidan Daud represented the man while deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama "

Baling police chief Supt Shamsudin Mamat said a Patrol Car Unit (MPV) from the Gerik district police headquarters (IPD) in Perak received information from officers on duty at a roadblock in Sungai Lebey, Gerik, at 4am. They were informed of a suspicious Proton Perdana car speeding through the police checkpoint. He said the Gerik MPV had conducted Op Kesan in the surrounding area and tracked down the suspects’ vehicle at a petrol station in Kuala Rui, Gerik. “When police attempted to conduct an inspection, the suspects accelerated the vehicle, prompting the police to pursue the car until it entered the Baling border, Kedah. The Gerik MPV then requested assistance from the Baling MPV. “The suspects’ vehicle was driven in a manner which endangered the lives of road users from the opposite direction, and to prevent the suspect vehicle from colliding with other vehicles, the Gerik MPV patrol members issued three warnings through the ‘spectra’ communication device,” Shamsudin said in a statement today. The suspects refused to stop their car, forcing the patrol car members to fire five warning shots, two of which hit the vehicle’s bonnet. However, the vehicle continued to speed before skidding on the Kuala Pegang Bridge, and two suspects, believed to be the driver and front passenger, fled under the bridge and escaped. He said an inspection of the vehicle found a man and three women believed to be foreigners aged between 23 and 39 without valid identification or travel documents. “The suspects and vehicle were taken to the Baling district police headquarters for further investigation. No casualties were reported in this incident,” Shamsudin said. One suspect, a local man in his 30s who fled, was apprehended at the Gerik Bus Station at 3pm today, while another suspect remains at large. The authorities will also investigate the policemen to determine whether they followed procedures when opening fire. “Police advise the public not to make any speculation that could jeopardise the peace and credibility of any party or ongoing investigations,” he said. — Bernama "

Judge Halilah Suboh ordered the two lawyers, Mark Robin Tallala and G. Mahadeva, and their client, Jagmohan Singh Sandhu, to serve the sentence effective today. However, the court allowed the application of lawyer Datuk Harpal Singh Grewal, who represented the three respondents, for a stay of execution of the prison sentence, while waiting for an appeal to be filed in the High Court. Before sentencing, Halilah said the court found the respondents intended to commit contempt of court by preparing and filing false evidence in the form of a witness statement of Allen David Martinez. “As court officers, we all have a responsibility not to mislead the court by submitting dishonest evidence or statements. Each of us has a heavy responsibility and burden in carrying out our respective duties and roles, based on the principles of law and justice. “As lawyers, justice is owed, not only to their respective clients but also to the public and the court. This also becomes the duty of respondents, as defence counsel and lawyers. “In this case, the witness statement was intentionally and dishonestly filed. The respondents knew the witness statement was not the actual Martinez statement. Therefore, they (respondents) deliberately misled this court,” she said. The judge added that if the matter had not been noticed and disclosed before the trial, the impugned statement would have been used during the trial, and interfered with the fairness of the case. “Therefore, the court believes that imprisonment is appropriate, suitable, and reasonable, to be imposed on the three respondents. A fine would not be appropriate, because it would not reflect the seriousness of the offence,” Halilah said. The proceedings were also attended by lawyer Bhavanash Sharma Gurchan Singh as the applicant. On October 13 last year, the Court of Appeal allowed Bhavanash Sharma’s appeal and found the three individuals guilty of contempt of court by preparing and filing false evidence regarding Martinez’s witness statement, filed on February 28, 2020, in the Sessions Court. According to the case facts, the impugned witness statement of Martinez was filed by Mark Robin and Mahadeva, through their firm, on February 28, 2020, without any communication, confirmation, or meeting with Martinez. On March 3, 2020, Martinez filed an affidavit denying each and every answer in the impugned witness statement. Most importantly, he averred that he neither communicated with nor met with the contemnors, prior to the filing of the impugned witness statement. Mark Robin and Mahadeva later admitted to having never met nor sought Martinez’s confirmation before the filing of the impugned witness statement. They blamed Jagmohan and said they relied solely on their client’s instructions, and the supposition the latter had finalised the contents of the impugned witness statement with Martinez. — Bernama "

A three-member panel of judges led by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail sentenced Aaron Teoh Eng Wan and his wife En Sit Mooi to 30 years’ imprisonment, starting from the date of their arrest on May 26, 2017. The two other judges were Justices Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah. Justice Hadhariah, in delivering the court’s decision, set aside the couple’s murder conviction and death sentence, and convicted them on the charge of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. She said High Court judge Datuk Noorin Badaruddin made an error when she did not distinguish the difference between Section 299 and Section 300 of the Penal Code and this warranted appellate intervention. Teoh, 40, and En, 43, were convicted of causing the death of Adrian Teoh Wai Kit, the oldest of their two children, at a premises in the Regalia Business Centre, Subang Jaya, between 2pm and 3.30pm on May 26, 2017. Lawyers S. Jayananda Rao and Saladin Mohd Yasin, representing Teoh and En respectively, argued that the couple should not be convicted of murder but on a lesser charge of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On May 21, 2021, the High Court in Shah Alam sentenced the couple to death after finding them guilty of killing their son. The High Court also sentenced Teoh to eight years in jail for another charge of abuse which resulted in injuries to the victim. However, Teoh withdrew his appeal today against this decision as he has already served the sentence. The testimony of prosecution witnesses such as the chemist confirmed there was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) belonging to Teoh and the victim on a cane found at the scene and the CCTV recording at the premises showed En dragging the weak and feeble victim several times.

In the first case, the Federal Court commuted the death sentence of an Indonesian man to 30 years imprisonment for murdering his girlfriend for ending their relationship. Court of Appeal President Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who led a three-member panel with Federal Court judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, also ordered Untung (one name only) to be given 12 strokes of the cane. The 42-year-old construction worker was ordered to serve the prison sentence from December 23, 2018, the date of his arrest. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Abang Iskandar said there was no merit in the accused’s appeal. On August 6, 2020, Untung was sentenced to death by the High Court for killing Indonesian Asmaul Chasanah, 28, at the Masjid Al-Husna car park in Bandar Sunway, Petaling Jaya, at 10.15pm on December 22, 2018. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on October 6, 2022. Based on the case details, Untung acquired a bottle of pesticide, carried a kitchen knife, and waited for Asmaul in the car park. He confided in her, expressing sadness and revealing his intention to commit suicide. Subsequently, he consumed the pesticide and stabbed himself. Instead of leaving the place, Asmaul mocked and insulted Untung, which provoked and led him to stab her. Deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution, while lawyers Gooi Soon Seng and Lim Wei Qi represented Untung. The second case saw the Court of Appeal commute an unemployed man’s death sentence to 35 years imprisonment for killing his girlfriend’s six-year-old son Muhammad Rayyan Hidayat Hairil Khan in 2018. The three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin also ordered Noraizuwan Hamali to be given 12 strokes of the cane and to serve the term from the date of his arrest on April 19, 2018. The court, however, dismissed Noraizuwan’s appeal to overturn his murder conviction. Noraizuwan, 32, was sentenced to death by the Kangar High Court on January 21, 2022, after he was found guilty of killing Rayyan at a house in Kampung Jejawi, Kangar, Perlis between 3.35pm on April 18, 2018, and 12.10am the following day.

In her judgment, Judge Hadhariah stated that the failure to call the owner of the car (Honda Accord) to testify did not create a loophole in the prosecution’s case because the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the appellants were found on the cloth inside the boot of the car. “This means that the appellants had access to the car, and the drugs were not concealed; the appellants also fled when the police attempted to arrest them. “According to the footage from closed-circuit television, the appellants used the car for two days. Therefore, the failure to call the car owner cannot raise inferences contradicting the prosecution’s case,” said Judge Hadhariah, who presided alongside Datuk Azmi Ariffin and Datuk Noorin Badaruddin. She said the court did not see breaks in the evidence chain as the items in the case had been marked, and there was no dispute regarding the matter. “In our opinion, the case items submitted in court are those seized from the car. Therefore, the conviction stands, the appellants’ appeal is dismissed and the conviction and sentence by the High Court are upheld,” she added.

This was after the three-member panel chaired by Judge Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera unanimously set aside the death sentence handed down by the Shah Alam High Court in 2018 against Sunil Singh, A. Malarvili, and C. Kavin Mukilan, for the murder of 68-year-old Balveer Kaur. Today, the appeals court also ordered Sunil, the former driver of the deceased, and Kavi Mukilan to be given 12 strokes of the rotan for the murder offence and another three strokes of the rotan for abduction. The total number of lashings that will be imposed on them is 15 but Malarvili was spared the whipping as the law prohibits such punishment on female offenders. In his broad judgment, Judge Vazeer said their lawyers had conceded there was an abduction but there was no evidence of demand made for a RM2 million ransom. “However, there were two phone calls made two hours after the abduction and the caller was a lady. The trial judge held there was overwhelming evidence it was Malarvili,” he said. The judge also pointed out the trial judge made a correct finding in calling the trio to enter their defence for murder and they were not denied a fair trial. “They knew very well the prosecution’s case against them. They had intentionally caused the death of the deceased by suffocating her by allegedly covering her nose and mouth and throwing the body into the sea,” said the judge. The other judges on the bench were Datuk Wong Kian Kheong and Datuk Noorin Badaruddin. The prosecution was led by deputy public prosecutor Noorhisham Jaafar while Malarvili and Kavin Mukilan were represented by lawyers Jasmine Cheong and Afifuddin Ahmad Hafifi, while counsel Amer Hamzah Arshad, Chew Jee San, Kitson Foong, and Joshua Tay appeared for Sunil. On December 27, 2018, the High Court Judge Datuk Zulkifli Bakar sentenced the trio to death for murdering Balveer Kaur at Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan, Perak, at 11.02pm on February 13, 2015. They were alleged to have covered the victim’s mouth, until she suffocated to death, and then threw the body into the sea, and charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code which carries the death sentence, if found guilty. They were also found guilty of abducting Balveer Kaur and wrongfully confining her for ransom of RM2 million at a construction site in Sunway Pyramid, Bandar Sunway, at 12pm until 5.53pm, on February 13, 2015. The offence, under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961, carries the death sentence or life imprisonment, and shall, if not sentenced to death, also be liable to whipping, if found guilty. — Bernama "

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (JSJK) director, Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said police have identified a trend in which companies are registered for ‘dummy’ accounts to be used. He said this tactic has been a preferred choice because it allows financial transactions to be carried out more frequently, involving larger amounts. “So besides individual mule accounts, there are now also corporate mule accounts that pose a greater financial threat because transactions disguised as company transactions involve amounts that can reach billions of ringgit. “To curb this, JSJK sees the need to strengthen the Semakmule portal by adding another module, listing companies suspected of being involved in commercial crime activities. That’s why Semakmule 2.0 has been established,” he told reporters after launching the Semakmule 2.0 portal at Mid Valley Megamall here today. Ramli said with the portal, the public will know which companies are involved in commercial crimes and avoid dealing with them. “A total of 107 companies have been listed in the Semakmule 2.0 database, and this number will continue to grow over time in line with ongoing investigations and new cases received every day. It is hoped that the public will use this portal to avoid falling victim to scams,” he said.

Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, heading a three-member panel of judges, rejected the appeal of former electrician, Taufeeq Mohsein Ahmad Tahir, 38. She said the conviction of the appellant was deemed safe. Hadhariah reading the unanimous decision, said the 12th prosecution witness (SP12) and SP13, who are the children of the accused and deceased were eyewitnesses, and the High Court judge had made a factual finding that the two were credible witnesses. Regarding the punishment, the judge said the court adopted the Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Act 2023 (Act 846) which gives the court discretion to impose the death penalty or imprisonment. “Therefore, the court set aside the death sentence handed down by the High Court and replaced it with a prison sentence of 30 years from the date of arrest (July 7, 2019) and 12 strokes of the rotan,” said Hadhariah, who sat with judges Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin.

Earlier, Taufeeq Mohsein’s lawyer M. Manoharan argued that there was no evidence that the two siblings (SP12 and SP13) witnessed the incident as both of them could not confirm what happened on the day in question. According to Manoharan, there is serious doubt as to whether injuries or other things caused the death of the deceased following the chemical report and autopsy clearly showing the presence of drugs in the blood and bile of the deceased. “The deceased was a ‘drug addict’ and it is possible that the drugs taken by the deceased could have caused death,” said Manoharan, who appeared together with co-counsels Johan Ariff and M. Hariharan. Deputy Public Prosecutor Eyu Ghim Siang argued that there were 51 injuries on the deceased and this (finding) was supported by the testimony of SP11, who was the pathologist who performed the autopsy on the body of the deceased. “SP11 in his testimony said the pattern of injuries on the deceased was caused by a blunt object and not because the deceased fell on her own. SP11 believed the cause of the deceased’s death was due to ‘multiple blunt force trauma to the body’,” he said. Eyu also said that the testimony from SP12 and SP13, who are child witnesses, showed that their father hit, punched and kicked the deceased. “SP12 saw the appellant holding the ‘blunt object’ and hitting the deceased with it while SP13 saw his father punching and kicking their mother,” he added. — Bernama "

He said the victim claimed he was introduced to digital currency using the “Accerx” platform. “He (victim) started making a digital currency exchange transfer of RM3,000 and made subsequent transactions because he was attracted by the display on the platform which showed a monetary gain amounting to RM 20,802,876.08. “The victim made a total of 16 transactions to six different bank accounts resulting in losses amounting to RM383,000,” he said in a statement today. Meanwhile, Yahaya said a 56-year-old retired banker was also deceived by the same tactics, resulting in him losing RM75,985 in August last year. He said the victim started making a digital currency exchange transfer of RM500 and then made subsequent transactions lured by the display on the platform which showed a profit of RM109,985.45. “Both victims realised that they had been scammed after they were informed that someone had filed a complaint against them (victims) for money laundering and they were required to withdraw all the profits. “They were told to first pay one per cent of the total profit, failing which the profit will be forfeited,” he added. Yahaya said the two victims lodged their reports at the Temerloh District Police Headquarters yesterday and the police were investigating the case under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. — Bernama "

Judicial Commissioner Noor Hayati Mat made the ruling after finding the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case against Muhamad Alqayyum Abdul Majid, 30, Nur Hasanah A. Latif, 26, and Mohamad Aizat Omar, 33, at the end of the prosecution case. “Therefore, the three accused are discharged and acquitted of the two charges without being called to enter a defence,” she said. Hayati said the prosecution failed to present evidence that the first accused (Muhamad Alqayyum) rented or lived in the third room in an apartment in Taman Cahaya, Kota Puteri, and failed to prove the man handled the drugs found, as there was no evidence of his fingerprints. “The prosecution failed to submit additional evidence, based on the defence’s suggestion that the plastic container containing drugs was not found on the floor in an open state but was found in the closet,” she said. The element of common intention was not proven, and the suggestion that the second accused (Nur Hasanah) was sleeping was confirmed by the raid leader, who was the second prosecution witness, although the sixth prosecution witness, who was the investigating officer, disagreed. On the third accused (Mohamad Aizat), Hayati said the fact that the third accused was not present during the raid and was not proven to stay permanently in the third room created a gap in the narrative of the prosecution’s case and the element of common intention also failed to be proven. Apart from that, the third room may be accessible to other people as several individuals are often in the house; besides, the issue of the access card not being seized from any of the accused raises questions about whether only they had access to the house. Deputy public prosecutor Siti Norliza Abdullah appeared for the prosecution, while lawyers Manian K. Marappan and Harpreet Kaur Gill represented Alqayyum, Nisrina Atirah Abd Razak represented Hasanah, and N. Mariappan represented Aizat. Six prosecution witnesses testified in the trial, which commenced on September 18 last year. The trio were charged together with distributing 204.76g of cannabis in the apartment at 2.35pm on September 17, 2019. The charge was framed under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which can be punished under Section 39(B) of the same law and read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code, which provides for death by hanging or life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the rattan, upon conviction. They were also accused of having in their possession 3.09g of ketamine and were charged under Section 12(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which is punishable under Section 12(3) of the same law, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of five years or a fine not exceeding RM100,000, or both if convicted. — Bernama "

The ministry’s Kuala Lumpur director Ariffin Samsudin said the suspects, aged between 35 and 57, were nabbed by a police team under Op Tiris 3.0. The operation led to the seizure of four five-tonne bonded lorries, two skid tanks with a capacity of 20,000 litres each, 40 intermediate bulk container (IBC) tanks, five suction pumps with hoses and 44,000 litres of diesel, with an estimated value about RM300,000. “A week’s police intelligence revealed that several bonded trucks were travelling to 20 petrol stations in the Ampang area, Selangor. They are believed to have been in operation since mid-December last year. “The affected petrol stations are being investigated as the same trucks have been making repeated purchases on a daily basis. Based on observations, the diesel purchased will be collected before being transferred to tankers arriving at the storage facility,” he told a press conference here today. Ariffin said the subsidised diesel bought by this syndicate is believed to be resold to factories and industries in Selangor and Negeri Sembilan at a lower price than the market price. He said the initial investigation revealed that the premises raided did not have licences or permits to trade in controlled goods, namely diesel. “The five men arrested were lorry drivers and workers at the storage facility. They were released on bail after their statements were taken,” he said. Ariffin emphasised that KPDN Kuala Lumpur did not rule out the possibility that it was a syndicated activity controlling certain areas. In another development, Ariffin said KPDN Kuala Lumpur has opened 10 investigation papers in 2023 with 15 arrests of locals under Ops Tiris and seized controlled items and other equipment, including vehicles, worth RM965,000. — Bernama "

This is the first time the Federal Court dismissed an application to review the death sentence after the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023 came into force last year. Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who chaired the panel, dismissed Junaidi Bambang’s application after ruling that the circumstances of the case did not warrant the court to exercise its discretion under the new amendment to the law to substitute the death sentence to life imprisonment. Also on the panel were Federal Court judges Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. Junaidi, 67, was found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court on April 28, 2005, for killing two-year-old Julaika, nine-year-old Julaiha, 11-year-old Juriyanti, at their house in Kampung Dusun Cini, in Pekan, Pahang, between 8pm on February 27, 2002 and 3.30pm the following day. The man lost his appeals at the Court of Appeal and Federal Court on April 12, 2010 and February 8, 2011, respectively. According to the facts of the case, Junaidi was not happy with his wife’s decision to bring two of their four daughters to live in Melaka and this caused a massive misunderstanding between them. Junaidi claimed that his sister-in-law, whom his wife and children stayed with while in Melaka, wanted to sell his daughters into prostitution. On the day of the incident, his wife returned to the family’s house and found that the front door was locked and that there was no response from her daughters when she called them. She then entered the house through the back door and saw Junaidi lying in the kitchen with froth coming from his mouth, while the three girls were found lying motionless in the living hall. Earlier today, Junaidi’s lawyer Selvi Sandrasegaram asked the court to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment of 35 years saying that her client is remorseful and hoped the court would give him a chance to reform himself. She said Junaidi has been in prison for 22 years. Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Amril Johari, however, urged the court to maintain the death sentence saying that the children were strangled with nylon ropes. — Bernama "

The Federal Court three-member bench led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, allowed A. Francis’ review application, under the Revision of the Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. Tengku Maimun ordered the 52-year-old man to serve the sentence from August 26, 1994, the date of his arrest. Francis has been behind bars for 30 years. The two other judges were Federal Court judges, Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Nordin Hassan. Lawyer Abdul Rashid Ismail, representing the accused, appealed to the court to commute Francis’ death sentence to life imprisonment, saying that the case was not the rarest of the rare, as the murder was not an act of terrorism and only involved a single victim. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) How May Ling, who was assisted by DPP Ng Siew Wee, objected to the application, and urged the court to maintain the death sentence, saying that the offence was committed in a gruesome, violent and brutal manner. “The offence was premeditated and done with a motive to sacrifice an innocent life to obtain a human skull for the purpose of getting ‘nombor ekor’,” How said. Francis was found guilty and sentenced to death by the Temerloh High Court on October 21, 1996, for killing Bangladeshi Ali Ahammed Mohammed Ullah, at the Kim Swee Leong oil palm plantation in Jalan Kuala Lumpur-Kuantan-Mentakab, Temerloh district, Pahang, between 9 pm and 11.30 pm on August 19, 1994. He lost his appeals at the Court of Appeal and Federal Court, which were dismissed on Sept 18, 2002 and March 21, 2005, respectively. The facts of the case revealed that Francis committed the offence on the advice of a bomoh as part of a ritual. He used a rattan cane to clobber Ali Ahammed’s head until he was unconscious, before decapitating him. He then buried Ali Ahammed’s head in an oil palm plantation. Francis was one of the 17 prisoners, aged between 45 and 63, whose death sentences and natural life imprisonment sentences were commuted to jail sentences of between 30 and 35 years. Twelve prisoners, including three Indonesians — Fernandez, Mohd Nor Fauzi and Buhanuddin Bardan — Moh Chuan Pin, Mohamad Deraman, Ong Lock Soon, Johan Yeob Idris, M.Poobalan, K. Nanda Kumar, S. Satiaselan, Wan Bakri Wan Ahmad and Ranjit Sing a/l Jit Singh, applied to the court to commute the death sentences which were imposed on them, to custodial sentences. The other four — Nor Jumalis Abdullah@Khamis, Ku Izham Ku Adnan, Suhirman Maksom (Indonesian) and A. Gunabalan —filed the review applications to commute their natural life imprisonment sentences. Poobalan, Nanda Kumar, Fernandez, and Burhanuddin were each given 12 strokes of the rattan. These 17 prisoners were convicted by the courts for murder, drug trafficking and discharging firearms while committing robbery offences. — Bernama "

In an operation on the same day, the Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau, according to him, arrested a 26-year-old local man and woman believed to be involved in drug trafficking activities on the island. “As a result of the raid, the police confiscated chemical powder weighing 74.03 kilogrammes (kg) and 7.41 kg of heroin base in Malaysia while 3.5 kg of heroin base was confiscated in Hong Kong with a total value estimated at RM7.89 million. “Also confiscated were equipment for drug packaging as well as molds for making statues and frog-shaped figurines. All the seized drugs can be used by a total of 399,169 people,” he said in a special press conference at the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters here today.

He said every vehicle the suspect stole was believed to have been smuggled into a neighbouring country. “The mastermind, Ah Ho, is believed to have received an order from a man in Thailand to steal a vehicle. Then, the vehicle will be left on the side of the road to be picked up by another man (believed to be hired by a man in Thailand), who will then be brought into that country. “Thus far, the suspect admitted to being involved in six cases of 4WD vehicle theft (four in Kuala Lumpur and two in Selangor) and receiving RM20,000 for each stolen vehicle,” Ahmad said during a press conference at the Sentul district police headquarters today. The police also seized two vehicles (believed to be a stolen car and a rental car), 26 sets of vehicle registration numbers and eight road taxes as well as other equipment believed to be used to steal vehicles. The suspect’s modus operandi was to target 4WD vehicles, like the Toyota Hilux, by placing a tracker on the vehicle. “The suspects will retrace the vehicles and the location where the vehicles were parked. In the evening, the suspects would turn off the alarm system using special tools and then steal the car. “The suspect also has the registration numbers of other 4WD vehicles to use on the stolen vehicles to avoid detection by the authorities,” he said. In another development, police arrested a 36-year-old man who was stealing goods from parked vehicles in Sentul on Saturday (December 30). Ahmad said the police also seized, among others, seven Touch N’ Go cards, a mobile phone, and cash. “The man, who works as a cook, would target vehicles parked on the roadside while travelling to work,” he said, adding the suspect admitted to being involved in six cases in Sentul and was remanded for four days. — Bernama "

A three-member bench comprising Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim and Federal Court judges Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais dismissed Mohd Ferdaus Suwardi’s appeal against his conviction and death sentence. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Abang Iskandar said the court maintained the death penalty imposed on Mohd Ferdaus by the lower courts in light of the gruesome manner in which the crime was committed, which was without any mercy. He said the court declined to invoke its discretion to substitute the death sentence on Ferdaus for a custodial sentence. Earlier, in dismissing Ferdaus’s appeal against his conviction, Justice Abang Iskandar said the lower courts were correct to find him guilty of killing the victims and that he failed to prove the balance of probability that he was legally insane when he committed the crime. Ferdaus, 37, was sentenced to death by the High Court on November 12, 2019, after he was found guilty of killing Syed Mohd Fazrul Syed Mohd Ridhuan, 23, and Wan Amir Hamzah Abu Hassan, 48, at a chicken processing factory in Jalan Bukit Kuda, Klang, Selangor between 6.30am and 9am on July 31, 2017. He lost his appeal at the Court of Appeal on May 26, 2022. According to the facts of the case, Ferdaus returned to his village after killing the two men and admitted to his mother what he had done. In his testimony, Ferdaus admitted to killing the two men, but on the defence of insanity under Section 84 of the Penal Code. However, the High Court judge, in considering the expert evidence of three psychiatrists, found that Ferdaus failed to prove the defence of insanity. In mitigation before the Federal Court today, lawyer Mohd Fadhly Yaacob asked the court to substitute the death sentence on his client to between 30 years and 33 years in jail, but deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee urged the court to maintain the death penalty. She said Ferdaus had attacked the deceased when they were asleep, and the attack was exceptionally cruel, adding that Syed Mohd Fazrul suffered 45 injuries while Wan Amir Hamzah had 23 injuries on his body. “He did not stop the attack when the deceased begged for mercy,” she said, adding that Mohd Ferdaus acted out of spite with vindictiveness, which warranted the most severe condemnation. — Bernama "

On March 26, 2019, the Georgetown High Court meted out the death sentence on Tarmizi, who is known as ‘Babun’, after he was found guilty of murdering a Form Five student at an apartment in Teluk Kumbar, Georgetown between 7.30 am and 7.30 pm on Oct 25, 2015.

He said the AG’s Office had no objection against the review, which only involved the sentence and not the conviction, which was confirmed by Deputy Public Prosecutor Noorhisham Mohd Jaafar. In mitigation, Azizul Shariman appealed for a minimum prison sentence on the basis that his client was only 20 years old at the time and was suffering from mild mental retardation due to drug abuse and did not receive maternal love as his mother died when he was 15. Noorhisham submitted that the accused had used a knife and the autopsy report showed the victim sustained 18 bruises, cuts, and abrasions, therefore, the prosecution requested a prison term of not less than 35 years. —  Bernama "

Penang police chief Datuk Khaw Kok Chin said the four suspects, aged between 24 and 37, were detained separately since 4.30pm around the Seberang Perai Tengah (SPT) district here after a police report was lodged about the incident. “One of the victims from the worker’s quarters, a 26-year-old Nepalese worker who lodged the police report, claimed they were robbed by police officers at the construction site at about 1.30am. The workers lost RM820 (RM520 cash and a handphone). “According to the victim, when he and other workers were sleeping, suddenly they heard knocks on the door and when they opened, three men in plain clothes had identified themselves as police officers,” he said. He added that upon entering the premises, they ransacked the place and asked the workers to pay RM5,000 but the workers declared that they did not have the amount and handed RM520 cash to them. Khaw said one of the workers was also assaulted and his handphone snatched away when they left the place. He added that initial investigations revealed that the site was the location for the construction of a factory while CCTV footage was available close to the site which recorded the incident, including the movement of the three suspects although the footage lacked clarity. “The two policemen detained were ranked a constable and corporal from the motorcycle patrol unit while two others were members of the public who had impersonated as police officers during the robbery. “Another person believed to have been involved is a security guard at the construction site,” he said. Apart from the two policemen, two other suspects involved have five and nine previous records for crime and drug related offences.

Judge Julia Ibrahim ordered the sentence on Yew Wei Liang, 45, to start from the date of his arrest on Aug 10, 2019. While delivering her verdict, Judge Julia said the court had taken into consideration the mitigating factors put forth, including Yew’s background and his cooperation during the investigation, and the victim’s family’s impact statement. “At the same time, the court has to emphasise the importance of public interest in such a case and mete out a deterrent sentence that will serve as a lesson to the public, because it started as a road rage case, being driven by anger and dissatisfaction and aggravated by the use of prohibited substances only invites bad consequences. “The court also weighed the impact statement from the victim’s family and this is indeed a great tragedy that has befallen and impacted all parties, either directly or indirectly,” she said. In mitigation, Yew’s lawyer Wee Choo Keong applied for a six-year jail sentence for his client on the basis that he did not intend to kill Syed Muhammad Danial, and that it was more of an unfortunate outcome in a road accident involving both parties. “The said accident was an unfortunate outcome which was brought about by the deceased. If the deceased had just driven away after the scuffle was dispersed by SP17 (prosecution witness), the deceased would still be alive today. “It would be manifestly unjust and unreasonable for this court to place the blame for the deceased’s death solely on the accused’s shoulders when it is crystal clear that there was no premeditation or intention to cause death on the part of the accused, but instead it was a mere unfortunate accident for both parties,” he said. He added that his client was supporting his wife and elderly parents, and as a result of his arrest and detention, his wife also suffered a miscarriage. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Raja Zaizul Faridah Raja Zaharudin pressed for a stiffer sentence commensurate with the offence as there was a prevalence of such incidents in the country. “This case had a significant impact on society and news about it went viral at the time. A stiff sentence should be imposed on the accused to teach him a lesson and make him an example so that people do not make the same mistake. “The consequences of the accused’s failure to control his emotions should be a lesson to the public when faced with difficult situations on the road,” she said. On Tuesday, the court found Yew guilty of the culpable homicide of Syed Muhammad Danial after the prosecution proved the case against him beyond a reasonable doubt under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code, which is punishable by up to 30 years in prison and a fine. On July 20, Judge Julia ordered Yew to enter his defence on the charge of causing the death of Syed Muhammad Danial under Section 302 of the same Code, after the prosecution proved a prima facie case against him at the end of its case. On Aug 22, 2019, Yew was charged with the murder of Syed Muhammad Danial, 29, at Kilometre 293.6 of the PLUS Highway (Kuala Lumpur-Seremban) between 1 pm and 2pm on Aug 10, 2019. — Bernama "

A three-judge panel led by Chief Justice of Malaya Tan Sri Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah handed down the sentence against N. Sanderasegaran, 35, after allowing the prosecution’s appeal to reinstate the original charge against the man in accordance with Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder. “The court found there was merit in the appeal by the appellant (prosecution) and agreed with the prosecution’s argument that the Court of Appeal erred when amending the charge from Section 302 of the Penal Code to Section 304(a) of the Penal Code (causing death). “Therefore, we allow the prosecution’s appeal. However, we have the discretion to either impose the death penalty or imprisonment (between 30 and 40 years),” said Judge Zabidin, who ordered the respondent (Sanderasegaran) to serve the prison sentence from the date of arrest on February 28, 2016. Sitting with Judge Zabidin at today’s proceedings are Federal Court Judge Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Judge Datuk Nordin Hassan.

However, on March 15 last year, the Court of Appeal substituted the mandatory death sentence with 20 years in prison for causing the woman’s death. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohd Fairuz Johar asked the court to impose the maximum prison sentence of 40 years, taking into account that the victim was a weak woman, and the autopsy report found 129 injuries on the victim’s body. “Based on the testimony of the pathologist, it is clear that the cause of death of the victim was due to head injuries,” he said. Lawyer Charan Singh, representing Sanderasegaran, requested a prison sentence of about 30 years as his client had no previous record. “My client was arrested on February 28, 2016, and he has been in jail since that date,” said Charan Singh, who lawyer Noor Farihah Arshad assisted. — Bernama "

Of late, there have been several raids involving large drug seizures by the police, of drugs hidden in cars which were used as storage, parked on the side of the road. Bukit Aman Narcotics Criminal Investigation Department (NCID) director, Datuk Seri Mohd Kamarudin Md Din, in acknowledging that it is the latest trend of drug trafficking syndicates, said that it presented challenges to the investigating officers. Mohd Kamarudin said that the tactic was used to avoid any meeting between the syndicate, ‘transporters’ and drug buyers. “If these drug buyers and transporters are arrested, they cannot provide information about the syndicate in detail, because they do not know each other, because there was no face-to-face meeting.” According to Mohd Kamarudin, it has caused the investigation to be complicated and challenging, due to the element of drug ownership, which is difficult to prove, as in most cases the owner of the vehicle is someone else, whether it is a rented or abandoned car, and does not belong to the individual arrested. In the meantime, the speed of digital technology also allows users to buy drugs online without seeing each other, because of drug delivery and then using a courier service. Mohd Kamarudin said that there are several websites on rhe dark web, which have been identified as carrying out drug buying and selling activities openly online. “Police will continue to carry out intelligence from time to time, to ensure that distribution activities through the dark web do not develop more widely,” he said. Meanwhile, NCID, according to Mohd Kamarudin, has successfully seized 19,147.56 kilogrammes of various types of drugs, and 13,913.44 litres of various types of liquid drugs, to combat drug distribution and abuse for 10 months this year. Also seized were 64,870.73 kg of ketum leaves and 49,013.56 litres of ketum water. The total value of the seizures was RM452.40 million.

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said they opened 4,435 investigation papers on non-existent investment cases involving losses amounting to RM364,537,421 during that period. “What is concerning is that the value of losses is equivalent to 20 per cent of the total loss value of commercial crime cases, which is RM1,824,715,080 recorded this year (until October),” he told a special media conference here today. He said that of the 4,435 non-investment cases investigated from January to October, a total of 4,051 cases involved online investment while 384 cases involved face-to-face investment. Ramli said that among the non-existent investment cases identified were schemes offering profits of up to 51 times within a period of three to six hours after the investments were made. He said investigations found that the syndicates began operating in October last year through Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and TikTok by offering investments in shares, digital currency and grants using the name of the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) with five packages from as low as RM300 to RM2,000. “So far, police have received 28 police reports nationwide, with total losses of RM1,242,839.34 related to this scam. The cases are being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code,” he said. Ramli said MIDA had issued a warning on Nov 9 last year about investment fraud using the agency’s name on their Facebook page. In addition, he said police have also traced the investment scheme known as CCF Trade and EXGCOO 2023, with 41 cases being investigated involving losses of RM8.05 million. “The investment schemes offered are based on the buying and selling of shares in Malaysia foreign markets like the United States and Hong Kong, with interested investors told to download applications for them to view their accounts generating profits, but which cannot be withdrawn,” he said. Ramli said investigations found that the victims involved in these fraud cases are aged between 29 and 79 and come from various employment backgrounds, with a majority of them being retirees and businessmen. Meanwhile, police have arrested four men aged between 37 and 63, who acted as company directors and individuals looking for mule account holders on suspicion of being involved in the Yomaex investment fraud syndicate. “So far, 45 individuals have been detained and 85 investigation papers opened, involving losses amounting to RM55,795,343.48,” he said. Ramli said they are still trying to trace the existence of love investment scams using almost the same modus operandi as love scams. Although the syndicate does not ask for money directly from their victims but would ask as a mentor to teach their victims about the investment methods. “Once they gain the victims’ trust, the syndicate will then ask them for money. So far, we know there are victims involved in love investment scams but there are some who do not want to come forward to lodge reports.” In addition, Ramli said police have also identified a trend of company registration and opening of bank accounts in the company’s name to be used as a mule account to enable financial transactions to be carried out more frequently and involving larger amounts. “So far, police have traced a total of 86 companies and 70 businesses registered for such purposes and, as a preventive measure, police proposes that procedures and conditions for the registration of companies and business be refined and tightened.” — Bernama "

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said the 31 men and nine women, aged between 20 and 55, were arrested in a three-day nationwide operation from October 29 onwards. Of those arrested, 38 were business owners, company directors, and company secretaries, while the rest included bank officers and agents scouting for mule account holders. “This operation was conducted after police received 76 reports from victims of investment schemes, which involved losses totalling RM50,620,880.29. “The victims, aged between 22 and 81, are mostly retirees and businessmen,” he said during a special media conference today. The syndicate’s modus operandi was to offer cryptocurrency investments giving high returns in a short period. “Investors are given access to monitor the cryptocurrency transaction activities in the accounts registered under the investors’ names, but the money cannot be taken out,” Ramli said. Through the operation, the police also detected a new trend by the syndicate, utilising registered companies and businesses as mule accounts. “So far, we have traced 73 bank accounts used by the syndicate, involving 51 companies. We believe these companies and businesses were registered simply for carrying out the scam,” he said. The syndicate would approach individuals facing financial problems or homeless people to use their names for the setting up of companies and then open a company account. “These individuals will be given a one-off payment or monthly payment. The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating,” Ramli said. — Bernama   "

Datuk Nor Badli Munawir Mohamad Alias Lafti’s appeal against his conviction was dismissed by the three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. Nor Badli, 57, on a RM600,000 bail pending disposal of his appeal, was ordered to begin his jail sentence today. However, he was spared the rotan as he is aged 50 and above. TH Heavy Engineering was formerly a Tabung Haji associate company. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Vazeer maintained the five-year imprisonment imposed on Nor Badli by the High Court for the CBT charges and the three-year jail for the money laundering charges. He ordered the sentences to run concurrently, which means Nor Badli will have to serve only five years in jail. In upholding the conviction, Justice Vazeer said both the Sessions Court and High Court did not make any perverse finding which warranted appellate intervention for those charges. However, he acquitted and discharged Nor Badli on two CBT charges and two money-laundering charges. The accused was initially charged with five counts of committing CBT and five counts of money laundering. He was acquitted of one money laundering charge and convicted of the other nine charges. The prosecution did not appeal against his acquittal. On September 30, 2019, the Sessions Court sentenced Nor Badli to seven years in jail for each of the five CBT charges to run concurrently and four years in jail for each of the four money-laundering charges, also to run concurrently. He was ordered to serve the four-year jail term after completing the seven-year sentence. On November 2, 2021, the High Court dismissed Nor Badli’s appeal on his conviction but allowed his appeal to reduce the jail sentence. His jail sentence for each of the CBT charges was reduced to five years to run concurrently, and for the money-laundering charges, the court reduced the jail term to three years’ imprisonment for each charge, also to run concurrently. He was ordered to serve the three-year jail sentence after completing his five-year jail term for the CBT offence. This means Nor Badli had to serve eight years in jail. According to the charge sheet for the three CBT charges, the accused committed the offence involving cheques for RM400,000, RM570,000 and RM600,000 at the office of THHE Fabricators Sdn Bhd in Menara UOA in Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, in April, June, and September 2013. Concerning the money-laundering charges, Nor Badli was convicted of receiving RM570,000 in proceeds from unlawful activities from Bicara Sepakat Sdn Bhd director Murhasmee Mukhtar at Old Town White Coffee in Ara Damansara, Petaling Jaya, on June 26, 2013. He was also convicted of receiving another RM600,000 in unlawful activity proceeds from Murhasmee at the same restaurant on September 11, 2013. The accused was acquitted of the two CBT charges involving cheques for RM430,000 and RM575,800 at THHE Fabricators office in June and October 2013. The court also acquitted him of two charges of receiving RM430,000 and RM570,000 in proceeds of unlawful activities from Coral Intoil director Mohd Razip Mohammad and RL Offshore Sdn Bhd director Hanaffi Daud, respectively. Nor Badli was accused of committing the offences at THHE Fabricators and the Leaf Dining restaurant at Solaris Mont Kiara on June 27, 2013, and November 1, 2013, respectively. The accused was represented by lawyers Kitson Foong, Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Datuk K.

Wilayah Satu PPM deputy commander Supt Rohizan Mohamad said the team carried out investigations and surveillance for over a month before initiating Op Taring Landai to raid a premise at the Bukit Kayu Hitam Industrial area at 7.30am. “During the raid, we detained six men, including two Thai nationals. Two were drivers of two tankers that were from Thailand. Three others detained were locals who were also lorry drivers, while the sixth suspect was the caretaker of the premises. “Investigations revealed the premises were used as a store for subsidised diesel sourced from local stations using lorries and later transferring the diesel into tanker lorries from Thailand to be smuggled into the neighbouring country. “Police also found pumps, hose pipes, and pump nozzles believed to have been used to transfer subsidised diesel,” he said during a press conference today. During the raid, 131,040 litres of subsidised diesel worth RM543,816 was seized from four tankers, two of which were from Thailand, while the four lorries are estimated to be worth RM160,000 each. Rohizan said initial investigations revealed the syndicate had been actively involved in smuggling subsidised diesel for the past four months and able to rake in hundreds of thousands from the illegal activity. Its modus operandi was to use bounded lorries to buy subsidised diesel in Kedah and Perlis to be stored at the premises hidden from public view, before transferring the diesel to lorries from Thailand. The suspects, aged between 23 and 60, were later handed to the investigating officer from the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living for further action. — Bernama "

Sessions Court Judge VM Mabel Sheela meted out the sentence on Nurul Asyiqin Mohamad Zahid, 27, and her housemate Awiin Chua, 30, after they pleaded guilty to two charges of child abuse on Aug 16. The court sentenced them to seven years’ jail on each charge and ordered them to serve the sentences concurrently from the date of their arrest on Aug 12. In her decision, Judge Mabel Sheela emphasised that such an incident should not have occurred, as the bond between a mother and her child is extraordinarily special. “If you (victim’s mother) ask your child to follow you, he will definitely do it even if it means enduring pain. “The court could not imagine the condition the victim would be in if this situation had continued, and we’re fortunate that the public intervened. Otherwise, the victim could have died.” Deputy public prosecutor Nur Diyana Zubir asked for a deterrent sentence, saying the victim had suffered more than 20 physical injuries and had been frequently abused. “In this case, we must commend the victim’s neighbours for their vigilance, which ultimately saved the victim. It is a case of public interest which has also attracted the attention of the consort of Johor Crown Prince, Che’ Puan Besar Khaleeda Bustamam,” she said. In mitigation, lawyer Nur Hazneena Zureen Jaesleen Mohd Hanafiah, representing the two accused, appealed for a lighter sentence, considering it was their first offence and they deeply regretted their actions. The two women committed the offences in a house on Jalan Wau Kikik 7, Bandar Layang Kasa, Pasir Gudang between July 1 and Aug 9 this year. They were charged under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum fine of RM50,000 or imprisonment of not more than 20 years, or both, on conviction. — Beenama "

In the summary judgment, Tengku Maimum said the appellants raised several issues, and the court found the main issue was whether the appellants were denied the right to a fair trial. “After hearing the lawyers’ submissions for the appellants and the prosecutor, as well as examining the grounds of the judgment and the appeal record, we are satisfied the entire trial was conducted in a manner which did not comply with the law. “This prejudiced the appellants and resulted in their unsafe conviction.

Earlier, lawyer Kitson Foong, representing Mohd Zulhiami, submitted that the defence only found out about the amendment of the date and time of the incident in the charge after examining the appeal records. “The High Court’s trial judge made the amendment after allowing the prosecution’s application without any notification. The lawyers were not informed of the amendment, and the three accused also did not know about it. “If an amendment is made, the charge should be reread to the client, and the plea should be recorded, and they can call witnesses for the defence,” he said.

Justice Vazeer Alam, who chaired the panel, said many issues were raised during the submissions by the prosecution and defence, and the panel needs to go through the evidence in detail. “Parties will be informed when we are ready, but it will not be long,” he said after the five-day appeal hearing, which began on September 4. Counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, representing the trio, had earlier completed his submissions. The prosecution, led by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Yusaini Amer Abdul Karim, concluded its submissions on October 17. On June 21, 2022, the Shah Alam High Court freed Samirah, 48, who is also Nazrin’s widow, and two teenagers, who are now 21 and 18, of murdering Nazrin after finding the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the trio at the end of its case.

Earlier, Muhammad Shafee submitted that the demise of the deceased (Nazrin) was a tragic accidental death and not murder. He said the defence had unveiled compelling evidence and testimonies of witnesses who disproved the allegation of incendiary fire, the alleged finding of petrol and the various elements of the murder charge. The counsel pointed out that the prosecution has not presented any credible evidence, let alone circumstantial evidence pointing to the irresistible conclusion that the accused persons had committed the murder. “To date, the prosecution cannot explain how the deceased sustained the blast-type injuries and how the blast-like pattern appeared on the master bedroom wall. “As such, the defence humbly prays that the prosecution’s appeal be dismissed, and the trial’s judge’s order of discharge and acquittal on the accused persons be upheld. “The defence humbly seeks the intervention of this court to correct the misdirection of fact and law by the learned trial judge concerning the acceptance of the finding of incendiary fire and petrol by the Fire and Rescue Department,” said Muhammad Shafee. — Bernama "

Khaw said based on the suspects’ directions, police then raided a two-storey bungalow lot in the Teluk Kumbar area at 7.10pm on Saturday and discovered a heroin-processing laboratory there. The syndicate is believed to have rented the premises, equipped with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to detect the authorities. They are believed to have carried out their drug processing and trafficking activities since early this year. “Police then raided two more locations yesterday, and based on preliminary investigations, the syndicate obtained its drugs from abroad and processed them at the house before selling them to buyers for the local market, raking in hundreds of thousands of ringgit each month. “The four who were arrested were drug distributors. Several other suspects, believed to have expertise in ‘cooking’ heroin, are still on the loose, and we are tracking them down,” he said, adding the syndicate has a network abroad and in several other states. In the raids, police seized heroin weighing 23.38kg, heroin base (18.4kg), syabu (1.507kg), caffeine powder (94.4kg), and various types of chemicals used for processing heroin, along with three cars. The police also confiscated six cars, cash, jewellery, and two motorcycles, which amounted to RM191,595. The seized narcotics can feed the drug habit of an estimated 1.22 million addicts. “One of the suspects has a cleaning company, while the other three are unemployed. Two of them have drug and crime-related records,” he said, adding that all the suspects have been remanded for a week, and the case is being investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. — Bernama   "

This comes after a decision by the Court of Appeal’s three-judge panel, chaired by Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, in dismissing the appeals by Azmil Muntapha Abas, 49, and Leong Peng Woon, 68, and upholding the decision of the Shah Alam High Court which dismissed the duo’s appeal to recover the money. Vazeer Alam, sitting with Judge Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah, said in a unanimous decision there was no error in the High Court’s decision, and the respondent (prosecutor) had proved that the application to forfeit the right to the money was following the law. “We are also satisfied the claims of the two appellants have also been considered by both courts (High Court and Sessions Court), and the decision reached by the court is based on the correct facts and law. “Therefore, the appeals of both appellants are rejected,” he said. On November 23, 2021, the Sessions Court allowed the government’s application to forfeit the money found in Azmil Muntapha’s office during a raid conducted by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in 2019. Azmil Muntapha, then the Judge of the Kuala Kubu Bharu Sessions Court, claimed he obtained the money from Leong, who is a contractor, through a RM200,000 loan to buy a house on auction in Hulu Selangor. The two then appealed against the decision in the High Court, which dismissed the appeals on April 10. Earlier, lawyer Awang Armadajaya Awang Mahmud, representing the appellants, submitted that the RM182,100 cannot be taken arbitrarily but can only be forfeited if the appellants failed to prove it was clean money. “The money is not related to official business but a loan from a friend to purchase a house in Hulu Selangor. The money has nothing to do with the corruption charge against the first appellant (Azmil Muntapha),” he said. Meanwhile, deputy public prosecutor Fauziah Daud said, as stated in the investigating officer’s affidavit, the money was confiscated in connection with an offence under Section 17 (a) of the MACC Act 2009, which is obtaining a bribe from an agent. “The first appellant said the money was borrowed from the second appellant (Leong), but the money in question was found in a very suspicious place, namely in the judge’s chambers. “Therefore, we are satisfied with the MACC’s investigation, which determined the money was from illegal sources,” she said. On October 19, 2022, Azmil was sentenced to six months in prison and fined RM25,000 by the Shah Alam Sessions Court after he was found guilty of corruption. Azmil Muntapha was charged as a Sessions Court judge to have obtained for himself RM5,000 without consideration from a person he knew had a connection with his official function involving court proceedings of six accused in criminal cases. He appealed against the decision, and the Shah Alam High Court reduced the sentence to one day jail and a RM12,000 fine. — Bernama "

MACC Chief Commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said three mills were raided today and the remaining two yesterday. He said MACC is not looking at issues of rice hoarding but rather potential elements of corruption. “MACC’s perspective is more on corruption offences that may occur, especially if it involves government funds related to subsidies and if they are misappropriated,” he said. He said this at a press conference after attending the Public Private Partnership Phase Two: The Joint Challenge of Integrity in Dealing with Crime programme, here, today. “I do not rule out the possibility that there will be other mills that will be inspected by the MACC to see that the subsidies paid are not commercialised with the rice production that is distributed,” he said. “In addition, MACC does not target any politician or any state government in the issue (raiding rice mills in Kedah) because our job is to examine any information and complaints received.”  Azam said MACC will act professionally to investigate individuals or parties involved. “Any party involved in the criminal issue of corruption and abuse of power will be our concern regardless of their background,” he said. He said MACC officers need to examine documents such as claims to see if there are elements of corruption and irregularities. According to him, MACC will also call the parties that regulate rice to help investigate the case. Commenting on another MACC investigations involving a businessman with a ‘Datuk’ title and his partner, who were arrested with RM38 million in cash in July, Azam said the investigation into the case is still ongoing. He said the probe is being carried out by a multi-agency task force including the MACC. “The task force is made up of various government agencies such as the Inland Revenue Board and others,” he said On July 25 this year, a ‘Datuk’ businessman and his partner were arrested in a massive operation. During the arrests, 200kg of gold worth RM60 million and 17 luxury cars were seized. — Bernama "

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah dismissed Goh Jie Keat’s appeal to reduce his jail sentence. Justice Vazeer, who delivered the court’s decision, said the 20 years’ jail sentence was not manifestly excessive considering how Goh had caused the girl’s death. He said Goh’s appeal did not have merit, adding the High Court judge had applied the correct principle of sentencing when imposing the 20 years’ jail term. Goh, 27, was initially charged with the murder of Serena Yip Pei Yee at a house in Jalan Kuang Gunung 4, Taman Kepong in Kuala Lumpur, between 7pm and 8pm on June 18, 2018. After eleven prosecution witnesses testified, Goh submitted a representation to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and his representation was accepted for the murder charge to be reduced to culpable homicide, not amounting to murder. On July 13, 2021, the High Court sentenced Goh to 20 years in jail after he pleaded guilty to culpable homicide not amounting to a murder charge. He, however, appealed to the Court of Appeal for a lower jail term. According to the case facts, Goh was cutting a plastic package with a pair of scissors when his niece persistently teased him and asked him to play with her.

Md Shahzada Saju’s appeal for a lower imprisonment term was dismissed today by the court’s three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah. In delivering the court decision, Justice Vazeer said the 20-year jail sentence was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case, where the killing was done in a gruesome manner. He said the High Court had not committed any error in imposing the 20 years’ jail term, and the appellate court did not want to disturb the sentence. Md Shahzada, 42, a former waiter, was initially charged on August 7, 2018, with murdering Sajeda-E Bulbul, 29, also a Bangladeshi, in an unnumbered room, in Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah in Dang Wangi, Kuala Lumpur, between 4.15am on July 3 and 3.16am on July 5, 2018. Acting on information, police inspected the scene and found two luggage containing the woman’s dismembered body parts by the riverbank of Sungai Gombak near Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur. A post-mortem confirmed her death was caused by an incised wound to the neck with decapitation. The police arrested Md Shahzada in Pengerang, Johor, on July 25, 2018. On May 26 last year, the High Court reduced Md Shahzada’s murder charge to the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder at the end of the prosecution’s case. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He, however, appealed to the Court of Appeal to reduce his jail term. The man was represented by lawyers Vijey Esvaren and M. Meera, while deputy public prosecutor Mohd Fuad Abdul Aziz acted for the prosecution. — Bernama "

Lokman said from the 239 offences identified, 23 were found to have expired licences or no licence at all but driving commercial vehicles. “Imagine 23 commercial vehicles are being driven by drivers who do not have a licence, or their licence had expired. This is certainly going to pose a serious danger to other road users, especially vehicles that a smaller in size. “We know that whenever commercial vehicles are involved in accidents, the drivers of the commercial vehicles do not suffer serious injuries, but others involved in the accidents may suffer serious injuries or in many cases, such accidents can be fatal.” He added that under a Special Ops for Motorcycles throughout last month, 135,446 notices or summons were issued for various offences, including lack of insurance, licence, road tax and for breaching traffic rules.

This followed a unanimous decision by a panel of three judges led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail to reinstate the Shah Alam Sessions Court’s decision, made on April 9, 2018,  in sentencing  Wan Ji to nine months in prison for the offence, and dismissed his appeal against the conviction and sentence. In reinstating the Shah Alam Sessions Court’s decision, Judge Hadhariah also set aside the decision of the Shah Alam High Court in July 2019 which sentenced Wan Ji, 41, to one year in prison. She said Wan Ji’s appeal had no merit because there was a lot of evidence showing that the appellant was the owner of the Facebook page. “Regarding the issue of punishment, the high court judge has no reason to increase the punishment. The sentence of nine months’ imprisonment should have been upheld. “Therefore, the court sets aside the one-year prison sentence handed down by the Shah Alam High Court against Wan Ji and reinstates the decision of the Shah Alam Sessions Court,” said Hadhariah who sat with judges Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. On the claim of no offence in the Sedition Act 1948 by Wan Ji in his appeal, she said the freedom of speech “The words said in the appellant’s Facebook are indeed inappropriate. If we are a genius in religious matters, we should not belittle others. “If you want to give religious advice, say it well. Don’t use inappropriate words, especially against the Sultan of Selangor, because now there are (laws against speaking on issues of religion, royalty and race.

The cleverer, you are, the more submissive you have to be. Don’t belittle other people,” said the judge. At today’s proceedings, the prosecution was conducted by deputy public prosecutor How May Ling, while lawyer Muhammad Faiz Fadzil represented Wan Ji.

The suspects also kept the victim locked up in different locations to make it hard for the police to find her. “The principal suspect then asked for a ransom from the victim’s 47-year-old husband in Indonesia, who then made two transactions totalling RM50,750. “However, the suspects still did not release the victim and had asked for an additional payment of RM540,000 from the woman’s husband,” he told a press conference today. Khaw said the victim’s husband, worried about his wife’s safety, decided to come to Malaysia and lodged a police report at the Kinrara police station in Selangor on September 15, following which Op Scorpion Rantai was launched to locate the woman. The woman was rescued in a raid on a house in Shah Alam at 5.15am on September 17, and an investigation revealed the victim was locked up for three days in Butterworth, four days in Puchong, and three days in Shah Alam. “During the raid, the police also rescued an Indonesian man who was also kidnapped by the suspects for an unrelated case,” he said. According to Khaw, the victim was found with injuries all over her body and was believed to have been chained, burned with cigarettes, beaten, and had her fingernails shoved down with needles and her hands and feet bound with cable ties. “When found, the victim was in a weak condition. However, the woman, who is an online trader, was fed by the suspects and is currently being treated at the hospital and reported to be in a stable condition,” he said. Further investigation revealed the main suspect was the victim’s husband’s business partner and the kidnapping was motivated by the man’s failure to pay a business debt. “Both of them (the main suspect and the victim’s husband) are contractors who run a business in Kuala Lumpur. “The police also seized several items including 23 mobile phones, 36 cable ties, RM4,800 cash, a metal chain, and vehicles used by the suspects to transport the victim,” Khaw said. The operation also led to the arrest of 14 individuals including the 35-year-old main suspect and two foreign men, in several locations in Selangor, Perak, and Kuala Lumpur on the same day the victim was rescued. The suspects have been remanded for seven days until September 23, and the case is being investigated under Section 3(1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961. — Bernama "

The three-man bench comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah allowed the prosecution’s appeal to overturn a High Court decision to acquit and discharge Kassim Tahir for the offence. In the court’s unanimous decision, Justice Hadhariah said Kassim’s conviction for the offence is restored. On the sentence, she said the court set aside the Sessions Court’s decision to impose ten years imprisonment for each charge and replaced it with eight years imprisonment for each charge to run concurrently. The sentence of whipping imposed by the Sessions Court on Kassim for each charge has been set aside. Justice Hadhariah ordered Kassim to begin his sentence today, and said the eight years jail sentence would also take into account the time served by him (Kassim). Earlier, she said the High Court erred in ruling that a preliminary inquiry should have been held before the Sessions Court accepted the victim’s evidence. On July 16, 2019, the Sessions Court sentenced Kassim to 10 years imprisonment with one stroke of the rotan for each charge, and Kassim was ordered to serve the sentences concurrently. On September 8, 2020, the High Court overturned the Sessions Court’s decision and acquitted and discharged him. According to the charge sheet, Kassim committed the offences in the bus in Ulu Tiram, Johor at 8pm between April 2016 and May 2016. Deputy public prosecutor Aida Khairuleen Azli submitted the Sessions Court judge did not need to conduct a preliminary inquiry under Section 133A of the Evidence Act as the victim was not a child of tender years when he testified in the court. She said the victim was already 14 years old when he provided detailed testimony on what Kassim did to him. In mitigation, the lawyer from the National Legal Aid Foundation Che Muji Che Noh representing Kassim said her client is suffering from a kidney problem and also asked the court to reduce the jail sentence. — Bernama "

They were ordered to serve the sentences from August 13, 2016, the date of their arrest. Court of Appeal’s three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah set aside the death sentence for drug trafficking imposed on the trio by the High Court, after ruling their conviction was not safe. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Hadhariah said the charge against the three men was defective as it was worded as trafficking by manufacturing the drug when it should have been a preparatory act to manufacture the drugs. She said the High Court judge failed to give a direction to the accused persons at the end of the prosecution’s case whether there was actual or presumed possession for them to prepare their defences and that adverse inference should also be drawn on the prosecution for not calling or offering material witnesses to the defence. Justice Hadhariah also said the court is exercising its discretion to reduce the charge to possession of the drugs. Dinakaran, an odd job worker, Asraful, a former student and Arivazhagan, a labourer, subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge. In 2019, the High Court found them guilty of trafficking 9,179.34 grammes of methamphetamine at a house in Jalan 3, Ampang, Selangor at noon on August 13, 2016.

https://selangorjournal.my/2023/09/tahfiz-fire-case-appelatte-court-upholds-youths-jail-sentence-2/,Tahfiz fire case: Appelatte court upholds youth’s jail sentence,2023-09-11T18:23:42+08:00,"PUTRAJAYA, Sept 11 — The Court of Appeal today upheld the decision of a High Court in ordering a 22-year-old man (PKK1) to be detained at the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, after finding him guilty of the murder of 23 people in a fire at Pusat Darul Quran Ittifaqiyah Tahfiz in 2017. A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali, and Datuk See Mun Chun dismissed the appeal by PKK1 after concluding that the High Court’s conviction of him was safe and should be upheld. The same panel also dismissed the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision in acquitting and discharging another man (PKK2), also aged 22, of the murder without calling for his defence. Justice Che Mohd Ruzima, who read out the court’s decision, said the court agreed with the findings of the High Court judge in ruling that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution was strong and pointed to one direction, namely that PKK1, along with another unidentified person, climbed behind the school’s fence to start a fire in the school which killed 23 people. He said the prosecution succeeded in proving through circumstantial evidence that the young man was responsible for starting the fire at the tahfiz school, knowing his actions were dangerous and could lead to death. “We agree with the findings of the High Court judge that the minor offender (PKK1) chose a lighter from several lighters in his bedroom, which shows that he knew which lighter he was using to start the fire at the tahfiz school,” Che Mohd Ruzima said. PKK1’s conduct was admissible under Section 8 of the Evidence Act 1950 and could be considered as part of the circumstantial evidence supporting the prima facie case against him. He said High Court Judge Datuk Azman Abdullah (now a Court of Appeal judge) was not wrong in his decision to reject the young man’s defence of alibi. This was based on the evidence of the defence and the prosecution that the young man was at the back fence of the tahfiz school building before the fire broke out. Regarding the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision to acquit and discharge PKK2, Justice Che Mohd Ruzima said the decision was factually and legally correct. This was based on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove that PKK2 was the one who inflicted bodily harm on all the victims and that he had the intention to cause death when doing the act. The court disagreed with the prosecution’s argument that PKK2 was the second person who climbed over the fence at the back of the tahfiz school along with PKK1, on the morning of the incident. He said that in proving the circumstantial evidence supporting the statements of the two prosecution witnesses, the prosecution relied on the inference on the size of the opening of the barbed wire fence of the building which was not that big and submitted that the second person who entered the tahfiz school compound together with the first youth was PKK2 due to his small body size. “We have found there is doubt about the facts regarding the fence at the back of the tahfiz school. Therefore, the conclusion relied upon by the prosecution to support the statements of two witnesses cannot be safely used against PKK2,” Justice Che Mohd Ruzima said. Two prosecution witnesses had testified that they saw an unidentified person climbing the back fence of the tahfiz school together with PKK1. On the contrary, the fact can also lead to the conclusion that the persons who climbed over the back fence along with PKK1 were probably two other witnesses who were also present at the scene. In his statement of defence, PKK1 denied having climbed the fence at the back of tahfiz school, but claimed that he was with his friends, namely PKK2 and the two witnesses. “If there is more than one inference, then the inference in favour of PKK2 must prevail, and the benefit of the conclusion must be in favour of PKK2,” he said. PKK1, who is now 22 years old, is appealing against the High Court ruling on August 17, 2020, ordering him to be detained at the pleasure of the Agong after finding him guilty of the murder. He was 16 years old at the time of the incident. According to the charge, the youth, together with another person still at large, was accused of murdering and causing the death of 23 people in the tahfiz centre at Jalan Keramat Hujung, Kampung Datuk Keramat, Wangsa Maju here, between 4.15am and 6.45am on September 14, 2017. He was charged with 23 counts of murder, each framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code and read together with Section 34 of the same law, which provides for the mandatory death sentence upon conviction. However, Section 97(1) of the Child Act 2001 stipulates that a death sentence shall not be pronounced or recorded against a person convicted of an offence if the child is under the age of 18, and in lieu of the death sentence, as provided under Section 97 (2) of the same law, the court shall order the person to be detained at the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. — Bernama "

The duo’s cases were heard separately today by the panel comprising Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat and Federal Court judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang. The court set aside the duo’s conviction and death sentences for the drug trafficking offences and substituted it with a charge for possession of the drugs.

Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Allaudeen Abdul Majid said the suspects, aged 23 to 30, were detained between 7pm and 9.15pm. The syndicate was believed to have been active for the past two months, and its modus operandi was to use vehicles to store drugs before distributing them to buyers. “In the first raid, a Thai married couple working in restaurants and a local man working at a horse farm in Selangor were arrested by the roadside of Taman Permata, Cheras. Checks revealed that the suspects did not have a criminal record but tested positive for drugs. “The arrest has led the police to the discovery of 15 packets of methamphetamine weighing 16 kilogrammes at a car park in Solaris Dutamas,” he said in a statement today. The police then arrested another suspect, a Thai woman believed to be the syndicate’s mastermind, at the lobby of a residence in Taman Kobena, Cheras.

A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah upheld the conviction against Anuar Yusof and his wife Murni Ahmad for the offence. It ruled their appeals did not have merits. Justice Hadhariah, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision, said the court found there was overwhelming evidence the 22-year-old Siti Hajar died due to the acts by the couple, who are her father and stepmother, by neglecting, abusing and starving her for a period of three to six months. She, however, set aside the death sentence imposed on the couple by the High Court and substituted it with an imprisonment of 40 years and ordered them to begin their jail sentence from the date of their arrest on April 26, 2016. “This is a very sad case and the worst case under Section 302 of the Penal Code that we have read,” said Justice Hadhariah. Following an amendment to Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court can impose a jail term of not less than 30 years and not exceeding 40 years on offenders if not given the death sentence. Male offenders shall also be punished with whipping of not less than 12 strokes. Anuar, 57, and Murni, 42, were found guilty by the High Court in 2021 for murdering Siti Hajar in a house along Jalan Air Putih, Taman Semarak, Binjai in Chukai at 10.45pm on April 26, 2016. They were sentenced to death, prompting them to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Apart from the couple, two of their children, Siti Sarah Anuar and her brother (who was 14 years old at the time of the incident) were also charged with murdering Siti Hajar, but they were acquitted and discharged by the High Court. The prosecution filed an appeal but it was struck out on January 10 last year, as they could not serve the notice of appeal to them. Siti Hajar weighed around 18 kg when she died. The deceased resided with her biological father, her stepmother, an older sister, and a younger brother in a rented house since 2008. The facts of the case revealed that Siti Hajar was highly emaciated with no flesh and only skin and bones. She had wounds on the head and bruises on her body including her anus. A forensic expert who examined the body confirmed Siti Hajar died due to bacterial infection in the lungs and anus caused by abuse, starvation and neglect. She also had 36 human bite marks on her back, both hands and feet and on her genital area. A witness testified in the trial that whenever Siti Hajar’s siblings wanted to eat, they were required to beat her up first and only after that will their mother allow them to eat. Lawyer Ghazali Ismail represented the couple while deputy public prosecutor Norzilati Izhani Zainal appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama "

In delivering the court’s unanimous decision, Justice Hadhariah said Sam’s conviction for the murder is safe to be upheld, and the court dismisses his appeal against his conviction. She said Sam’s conduct that had caused Kamal Long’s death was cruel. On the sentence, Justice Hadhariah, however, set aside the death sentence imposed on Sam by the High Court and replaced it with 35 years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane. Sam was found guilty by the High Court on October 8, 2021, for murdering Kamal, 50, a lifeguard, at the corridor of the Awana Sri Layang workers’ quarters in Genting Highlands in Bentong, Pahang at 10.30pm on October 4, 2017. He was sentenced to death. A bellman at the resort testified in the trial that he saw Sam kick Kamal’s face and on his ribs, and step on the deceased’s chest and face, causing him to hit his head on the wall. The witness claimed that Sam was ‘like kicking a ball’. In defence, the accused said Kamal, who was his roommate, had occasionally been stealing his belongings. He said on the night of the incident, both of them, whom he said shared a good relationship, were drinking alcohol in their room and were both drunk. He said after returning from the toilet, Sam realised that his handphone was missing and alleged that the deceased had taken it. Angered at this perceived theft, he demanded of Kamal as to where the handphone was but was told he (Kamal) did not know, at which Sam began beating him Lawyer Nik Mohamd Ikhwan Nik Mahamud, who was appointed by the court to represent Sam, asked the court to commute his client’s death sentence to imprisonment saying that Sam did not have the intention to cause the death of his best friend and that he only wanted to injure him. He said it was an error on the part of his client, who had resorted to violence instead of resolving the dispute. Deputy public prosecutor Parvin Hameedah Natchiar argued that witnesses who saw Sam hitting, kicking and injuring the deceased were warned by him (Sam) not to interfere. She said it was Sam’s attacks that evening that led to Kamal’s death, adding that the Kuala Lumpur Hospital forensic specialist testified that the deceased have suffered severe bleeding in his brain which resulted in his death. — Bernama "

Judge Norhazani Hamzah made the order after Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurfadzlin Mahmad Zulhasnan applied for Safiey, 29, whose real name is Mohd Safiuddin Ilias, to be granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal of all four counts. “The case has been dismissed. The accused is granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal from all the charges and bail is returned,” Norhazani said. Earlier, Nurfadzlin said the prosecution made the application on the grounds the accused will be charged again in Pahang and Johor as the victims, who are also witnesses in the case, were residing in those two states respectively. “If the trial is to proceed in this court, it will inconvenience the victims as they will have to travel back and forth,” he said. Lawyer, Harjeet Singh Sidhu, representing Safiey, had also urged the court to discharge and acquit his client of the four charges, saying the case has been going on for too long. The court today was supposed to hear Safiey’s preliminary objection against two of the four charges he was facing.

Judge K. Muniandy meted out the sentence after allowing the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Sept 15, 2022 decision of the Sessions Court to free Sabudin, 62, of both the corruption charges. He ordered the four-year prison sentence for each count to run concurrently, effective today, and the RM1 million fine, in default four years imprisonment. Judge Muniandy allowed the application of Sabudin’s lawyer K.Theivaendran to stay the execution pending his appeal at the Court of Appeal. Earlier, during submission, deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin, assisted by Natrah Fareha Rahmat, requested a 10-year prison sentence and a fine of RM1 million, taking into account public interest and the seriousness of the offence as it involved corruption. On Dec 18, 2020, the Sessions Court freed Sabudin of the two charges at the end of the prosecution case, but on March 24, 2022, he was ordered to enter his defence by the High Court, allowing the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Sessions Court’s decision.

Instead, the court’s three-man bench comprising Judges Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin allowed the MACC’s appeal to set aside the decision of the then judicial commissioner Roslan Mat Nor now High Court judge that the Commission must rely on its own MACC Act 2009 to apply for remand of suspects if it did not complete investigations within 24 hours of the arrest of the suspects. In delivering the court’s unanimous decision, Vazeer said the then judicial commissioner had erred in his interpretation of Section 49 of the MACC Act. “We note there is no specific provision in the MACC Act as to the course of investigation which is not completed within 24 hours.” He said MACC officers can use Section 29 (3) of the MACC Act and apply to the magistrate for a remand order against the suspects under Section 117 of the CPC if their investigation cannot be completed 24 hours after the arrest of the suspects. In his grounds of judgment dated May 11 this year, Roslan had ruled that MACC cannot use the CPC to remand suspects for further investigations and the Commission must use section 49 of the MACC Act 2009 which gives it specific powers to do so. He said MACC officers can make an arrest under section 49 (2) of the MACC Act and can ask for a remand order under section 49 (3) of the same Act. Roslan, in exercising his revisionary power, ruled that the remand order issued by a senior assistant registrar of the Temerloh High Court against six policemen including an inspector under Section 117 of the CPC did not comply with the law and hence, set aside the remand order. Deputy public prosecutor Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar appearing for the MACC today argued that Roslan had erred when he decided that Section 49 of the MACC Act is the sole provision that the MACC officers should rely on for the investigation and remand of suspects. He said that the provisions under the MACC Act and the CPC were applicable for any investigation carried out against suspects for offences under the MACC Act. Lawyer Datuk Geethan Ram representing three of the policemen countered by saying that the policemen were arrested for an offence allegedly committed under the MACC Act and as such the provisions of the MACC Act apply to the case and not the provisions under the CPC. As for the other three policemen, lawyers Revin Kumar Shasai Kumar, Lavanyia Raja and Eu Kah Mun were appointed individually to represent them. — Bernama "

Muallim police chief Mohd Hasni Mohd Nasir said the 38-year-old woman disclosed that the deception began when she received a phone call from a man claiming to be an employee of a courier company on Aug 3. “The caller stated that the victim had two parcels in her name containing five identity cards, five passports and five bank cards belonging to other people, before being connected to what was said to be the Perak and Bukit Aman contingent police headquarters with the syndicate’s intention of convincing the victim,” he said today. Mohd Hasni said the suspect, who was posing as an investigating officer, claimed there was an arrest warrant out on the victim for money laundering including human trafficking which ‘forced’ the woman to follow instructions including transferring the entire sum to 16 different accounts. “The panic-stricken woman followed the suspect’s instructions by transferring her money amounting to RM537,659 to the accounts given by the syndicate from Aug 3 to Aug 12 through 25 transactions.” He said the lecturer only realised she was the victim of a fraud syndicate after her husband saw his wife’s peculiar behaviour of nervously glancing at the phone and wanting to borrow money to make payments. The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code while the public is advised not to be easily deceived by similar modus operandi and to always check with the National Scam Response Centre at the 997 number.

The accused, who was not represented by a lawyer, appealed for a lighter sentence on the grounds that he had repented and regretted his actions. The court sentenced him to 30 years in prison and 10 strokes of the rotan for each count of rape.

He was alleged to have stalked the woman by repeatedly harassing her through three communications on his Twitter account last month. According to the charge, Mohamad Safiq was charged with repeatedly harassing Acacia Mardiana Daud, 31, through the Twitter application under the account name “@sopert99” by sending three communications which expressed his feelings for the woman on her Twitter account “@ShaFoShizzle” which was read at a house here.

He faced imprisonment for up to three years or with a fine or with both if found guilty. Deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas did not offer bail taking into account that Mohamad Safiq had previously violated bail conditions for a case involving the same victim in the United Kingdom (UK). Lawyer Fithril Hakim Ab Jalil, representing Mohamad Safiq, did not object to it. According to Zilfinaz, the accused was supposed to appear in a court in the UK to explain for breaching his bail last June 2, but he fled to Malaysia resulting in his name being blacklisted in the UK. “I was also instructed to send the accused for observation to the Forensic Psychiatry Unit at Ulu Kinta Hospital. “His family had also sent him to Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) for treatment and the hospital has given a medical report on him today,” she said, adding that Mohamad Safiq has been warded at the psychiatric ward at HKL since last July 17.

The accused flew to the UK to continue such acts against the same victim. “We humbly pray to restrain the accused from going anywhere near the victim and not to communicate by any means with the victim until the conclusion of this case,” he said. Sasha Diana allowed the prosecution’s request to refer the accused to Ulu Kinta Hospital and will set the bail amount on the accused after the hospital had completed its observation of him. The court also allowed Wee’s application for a protection order and fixed Sept 7 for mention. Through a recent post on Instagram,  Acacia Mardiana revealed that she had been living in fear for eight years because of sexual harassment by a man on social media. Her plight caught the attention of Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil who advised Acacia Mardiana to submit evidence including police reports and screenshots to the government’s official email for further action. — Bernama "

He then led a police team to a forest area in Kampung Panti Kota Tinggi where he buried the baby. The team found the baby’s corpse and sent it for a post-mortem.

In mitigation, both Fikri’s counsel Anita Vijaya Rajah and Nurul Filzatun’s lawyer Shaik Saleem Shaik Mohamed Daud asked the court not to impose the death sentence.

https://selangorjournal.my/2023/07/former-dbkl-senior-deputy-director-found-guilty-on-two-charges-of-bribery/,Former DBKL senior deputy director found guilty on two charges of bribery,2023-07-27T18:05:21+08:00,"KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 — The High Court today found former Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) senior deputy director Sabudin Mohd Salleh guilty on two charges of obtaining bribes amounting to RM200,000 for the issuance of work permits. Judge K. Muniandy made the ruling after allowing the prosecution’s appeal to set aside a Sessions Court’s decision on September 15, 2022, which acquitted Sabudin, 61, of two corruption charges at the end of the defence case. He fixed August 15 to hear mitigation by the accused and to impose the sentence. In his judgment, the judge said an error of law has been committed by the Session Court judge when she misdirected on the law applicable to the evidence of the third prosecution witness (PW3), Wong May Kuan, who for all intends and purposes shall not be regarded as an accomplice pursuant to Section 52 (1) (a) of Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act (MACC). “Although the PW3 was the giver of the bribe, it came about because of the demand made by the accused for sponsorship when PW3 went to see him to lodge a complaint, despite not having obtained the contract for work yet. “Thus, the finding by the Session Court judge is not supported by evidence, and the decision made is against the weight of evidence. The court found that there is no proper judicial evaluation of the evidence,” he said adding that PW3’s attendance at the wedding reception of the accused’s son only makes it more probable for the accused to have known PW3. According to the judge, the payment made was for the work contract awarded to PW3, which is proved by the existence of salient contract documents, like the Work Permit and Certificate of Progress Payments which have got the approval of the accused. Judge Muniandy said by virtue of the errors and misdirection by the Session Court judge, appellate intervention is justified for this court to correct it on appeal. “On that score, this court decides to allow the appeal by the prosecution, thus setting aside the order of discharge and acquittal and substituting it with a finding of guilty and conviction on the two charges preferred against the accused under Section 17 (a) of the MACC Act pursuant to Section 316 (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code,” he said. On December 18, 2020, the Sessions Court acquitted Sabudin of the two charges at the end of the prosecution’s case. However, Sabudin was ordered to enter his defence on both charges after the High Court, on March 24, 2022, allowed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Sessions Court’s ruling. On both charges, Sabudin, who was then senior deputy director at the DBKL Civil Engineering and Urban Transport division was charged with corruptly receiving a bribe of RM200,000 in cash from Wong, a subcontractor of Dusari Niaga that was tasked with grinding and resurfacing works for Kuala Lumpur City Hall for the Year 2018/2020 (2017/A214) as an inducement for him to issue the work permit to the company. He was charged with committing the offences at a petrol station convenience store at Jalan Lingkaran Tengah 2, Bukit Antarabangsa here, and in front of his residence in Ukay Perdana, Ampang, on June 9, 2018, and January 17, 2019, respectively. The charges were framed under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act which provides imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the amount of bribe involved, or RM10,000, whichever is higher. The prosecution was led by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin meanwhile lawyer K. Theivaendran, represented Sabudin. — Bernama "

Ng Hui Yee will have to go back to the Shah Alam High Court to apply for a reduction of her bail. Justice Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, who led the three-member bench said the High Court can hear Ng’s application under Section 389 of the Criminal Procedure Code, adding the court agreed with the preliminary objection raised by the prosecution that Ng was allowed to file an application for the High Court to consider her request to vary the terms of the bail order. He said the High Court can consider Ng’s application as it is not functus officio (once the court made a decision it does not have the power to re-examine that decision). Justices Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali and Datuk Wong Kian Kheong also presided on the bench. On May 24, the Shah Alam High Court released Ng on RM500,000 bail pending trial under Section 388 of the Criminal Procedure Code which states a person accused of an unbailable offence can ask to be released on bail, however, she has yet to post the amount due to the high quantum imposed and is currently remanded at Kajang prison. Ng, 33, and her husband Khor Swee Boon, 30, were jointly charged with killing Cho Lim Fong, who died of severe injuries when a parcel left on the bonnet of his car exploded outside a restaurant along Jalan Pandan Indah 1/22, Kuala Lumpur at 8.55pm on December 29, last year. In today’s proceeding, Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Siew Wee raised a preliminary objection saying Ng’s application is incompetent and the appellate court should not entertain the request as she has yet to exhaust her right to apply for a variation of the bail order in the High Court. Ng’s counsel, RSN Rayer asked the court to reduce the bail amount to an affordable sum of RM20,000, arguing that it was unfair for his client to be kept in prison when she was entitled to bail but the High Court judge fixed bail at RM50,000. — Bernama "

The Court’s three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk P. Ravinthran and Datuk Nordin Hassan also upheld the High Court order for Suhaimi Alias, 46, to be whipped 10 times. In the court’s judgment dated July 7, Justice Ravinthran dismissed Suhaimi’s appeal against his conviction and sentence and ruled that there was no reason for the Court of Appeal to interfere with the High Court’s decision. He said there was overwhelming evidence in respect of the common intention of all the accused persons, including Suhaimi, to abduct the victims. “They had impersonated police officers to bring the victims to a hotel room. The victims were blindfolded and confined in the room. This is a criminal act,” Justice Ravinthran said. Suhaimi and two others, Raja Mohd Hafiz Raja Shuib and Myanmar national Nobi Hussein Abutar, were charged with kidnapping the three Bangladeshis — Md Gholam Faruque, Mohamed Rafik and Sojib — for RM50,000 ransom at a mini market in Jalan Meru Klang, Selangor at 4am on March 16, 2014. Raja Hafiz died during the course of the trial and the charge against him was withdrawn in 2017. The High Court proceeded with the trial against Suhaimi and Nobi Hussein and convicted them at the end of the trial. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to be given 10 lashes of whipping. In the 19-page judgment, Justice Ravinthran also said the court finds the 10 lashes of whipping is justified, based on the facts of the case where Suhaimi and his accomplices targeted vulnerable persons such as foreign workers. “They impersonated police officers and abducted them. The ransom demanded was a huge sum. Two of the victims were badly beaten up as the raiding officer told the court that they were immediately sent to the hospital after being rescued,” he said, adding that interference with the sentence of the High Court is not warranted in all the circumstances of the case. Nobi Hussein’s appeal against his conviction and sentence is fixed for hearing on July 26. — Bernama "

BEC is a type of scam targeting companies where the syndicates are believed to commit fraud by hacking the companies’ email for the purpose of monitoring their transactions before posing as business partners or suppliers to get the companies to wire transfer payments. Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said this was made possible with the cooperation of Bank Negara Malaysia, the respective financial institutions involved and the victim who lodged a police report last Thursday. He said based on its investigation, since January this year, the victim’s company based in Malaysia has been dealing with a company abroad to obtain LPG gas (liquefied petroleum gas). “However, on June 22, the victim’s company received an email from a representative of the supplier company instructing that payment be made to a new account,” he said in a statement last night. Ramli said the company then made a payment to the account, but the victim only realised he was duped when the supplier company informed that they have yet to receive the payment. He said acting on information, the police in collaboration with BNM and the financial institutions involved traced the bank transfers and managed to stop a sum of  RM28,361,636.68 from being transferred to a foreign bank account. Ramli said the case is still being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. He said as a preventive measure, the public, especially businesses that use email in their daily affairs, are reminded to always be careful and ensure that the email they receive is from the real buyer or seller. “Beware if there are instructions related to a change in bank account for payment purposes. Ideally, contact the seller or supplier company via phone call for confirmation,” he said. — Bernama "

After that, victims would be asked to make a number of financial transactions with an investment package in the currency of the victim’s choice. He said the syndicate was believed to have been operating in China and the police are still investigating to determine if the group was carrying out activities in Malaysia had any connection. The syndicate was targeting 30 to 50 Chinese customers a day to join the investment. “The syndicate is able to earn 10 to 15 per cent as commission, which is around RM50,000 to RM100,000. “Of the 10 suspects arrested, only one has a valid travel pass.

Wong failed to file the returns for the taxable income of RM1,827,149 for the assessment year 2021 and RM1,558,176 for 2022, which meant she should have paid a tax of RM812,478 for both the years combined.

Mohd Zarul Afifi Mohd Zaki was ordered by the Court of Appeal three-member bench led by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail to serve his jail sentence from today. The 36-year-old man has been on RM8,000 bail pending the disposal of his appeal today. He lost his appeal to set aside his conviction but succeeded in getting the court to reduce his sentence from six years’ jail and two strokes of the cane to just one-year imprisonment. Justice Hadhariah, who sat with Justices Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, said there was overwhelming evidence to support the High Court’s decision to convict Mohd Zarul for the offence. However, she said the court agreed with Mohd Zarul’s counsel M.M Athimulan that the six-year imprisonment and two strokes of the cane were manifestly excessive since there was no force used or injuries inflicted on the victim. On April 28, 2021, the Sessions Court acquitted and discharged Mohd Zarul on the charge of committing sexual physical assault by touching the wrists and stomach of the boy who was taking his bath at 3.10 pm in the bathroom of the school’s hostel in Kuantan, Pahang, on March 23, 2019. On January 18, 2022, the High Court allowed the prosecution’s appeal and convicted Mohd Zarul and sentenced him to six years in jail and two strokes of the cane. Mohd Zarul then appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the appeal proceedings today, Athimulan asked the court to restore the Sessions Court’s decision as he said the court (Sessions Court) had rightly acquitted his client as the incident happened spontaneously and not intentionally. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Muhammad Azmi Mashud, who was assisted by DPP Aida Khairuleen Azli argued that Mohd Zarul’s evidence that he did not realise he entered the school compound because he was playing Pokemon Go game on his handphone, was merely a bare denial. He said Mohd Zarul’s testimony that he entered the bathroom to take out his clothes and accidentally touched the victim’s stomach was also a bare denial. — Bernama "

In her judgment to free and acquit Rozman, 59, from charges of using his position to obtain contracts for LLPM, Judge Rozina ruled that the prosecution’s failure to call Datuk Wee Jack Seng, then the Labuan Port Authority (LPA) chairman, to testify had brought about an issue of an adverse inference. “Without his (Wee’s) testimony, the question of the accused’s influence on the decision reached by the LPA meeting remains unanswered. “Based on the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses, the court finds that the accused is not the highest power in LPA and not the individual who chaired the meetings (on Jan 4, 2018 and March 21, 2018). This shows that there are loopholes in the prosecution’s narrative,” she said, further stating that their testimonies showed that the port authority did not want LLPM to be given the chance to be appointed as the operator. She also said that the prosecution’s foundation for prosecution turned out to be baseless because they failed to prove that there was an operator appointed by LPA, as the decision made during the March 21, 2018 meeting was to defer the appointment of a new operator and there was no such appointment made on that date as well. Judge Rozina also pointed out that the prosecution failed to prove that the accused, Rozman, had taken or asked to take action to ensure LLPM was appointed as operator. “Instead, there is opposing testimony as prosecution witnesses stated that during the LPA meetings, the accused informed that LP Multi Terminal Sdn Bhd had the best potential to be appointed operator and not LLPM,” she ruled. Meanwhile, Rozman, who is Labuan Parti Warisan division chief, told reporters after the ruling today that he was grateful for the court’s decision and thanked his lawyers, family and friends who continued to support him. “Alhamdulilah… thank Allah, right from the start I stated that I was innocent and when I was charged in court, I left it to the court to conduct its matters and was confident of the legal process… today justice has been served,” he said. – Bernama "

Judge K. Muniandy set the date after hearing submissions by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin, and lawyer K. Theivaendran who represented Sabudin. In his submission, Wan Shaharuddin argued that the trial judge was confused by the charges against the respondent (Sabudin) and had blamed the appellant (prosecution) for failing to establish the need for the respondent to solicit bribes from the prosecution’s main witness, Wong May Kuan, who is a subcontractor of Dusari Niaga. “The trial judge had committed a gross error and misdirection when he failed to consider the evidence that did not favour the respondent when deciding that the respondent had given an honest testimony,” he said and requested the court to allow its appeal, as well as to set aside Sabudin’s acquittal. Meanwhile, Theivaendran submitted that the trial judge had made the right finding when acquitting his client based on the testimony of witnesses. “Therefore, we request that the prosecution’s appeal be dismissed,” said the lawyer. The appeal by the prosecution was filed last year against a Sessions Court’s decision on September 15, 2022, which acquitted Sabudin, 61, of two corruption charges at the end of the defence case. Sabudin was ordered to enter his defence on both charges after the High Court, on March 24, 2022, allowed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the December 18, 2020 decision by the Sessions Court in acquitting him of the two charges at the end of the prosecution’s case. On both the charges, Sabudin, who was then senior deputy director at the DBKL Civil Engineering and Urban Transport division was charged with corruptly receiving a bribe of RM200,000 in cash from Wong May Kuan, a subcontractor of Dusari Niaga that was tasked with grinding and resurfacing works for Kuala Lumpur City Hall for the Year 2018/2020 (2017/A214) as an inducement for him to issue work permit to the company. He was charged with committing the offences at a petrol station convenience store at Jalan Lingkaran Tengah 2, Bukit Antarabangsa here, and in front of his residence in Ukay Perdana, Ampang, on June 9, 2018, and January 17, 2019, respectively. The charges were framed under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act which provides imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the amount of bribe involved, or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction. — Bernama "

This was after the three-member panel comprising Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk M. Gunalan and Datuk Lim Chong Fong allowed the teenager’s appeal to set aside the lower court’s order that he be sent to Henry Gurney School for three years. Lim, who delivered the court’s decision, said the appropriate order to be given to the male teenager, who is now 18 years old, is for him to perform community service for a total of 100 hours under the supervision of the social welfare department, adding that it also includes counselling and religious and moral education. “We acknowledge the order now meted out against the appellant may not be palatable and ideal to everyone. We prefer to place our trust in the appellant that he has learnt from his hideous episode and will not repeat it,” he said. Lim said the order of the Magistrate’s Court sitting as a Court for Children to send the teenager to Henry Gurney School, which is under the purview of the director-general of Prisons, based on the probation report was illegal as there was an absence of the welfare officer’s explanation in the report to show that the teenager is not suitable to be rehabilitated in an approved school. He said in meting the sentence on a person, the court must strike a balance that serves the public interest and deters the re-commissioning of the crime as well as rehabilitating the person. The court is convinced that the teenager fell astray but he is now filled with remorse and shame for what he did, adding that the teenager’s father had admitted that his son showed a change of attitude for the better. Lim said the teenager now spends more time at home focusing on his studies and less time on his mobile phone and also watches animated shows to avoid the urge to surf pornography websites. Meanwhile, Justice Hadhariah advised the teenager to take the court’s decision as a lesson and warning for him not to repeat the offence or else he would not have a second chance. “If you commit the offence again, the law will take its course. If the sexual offence is under the Penal Code, then the sentence under that provision will apply,” she said. Justice Hadhariah also said it was the responsibility of the welfare officers to decide what type of community service to give to the teenager. She also directed the prosecution to serve the court’s order to the welfare officers for it to be enforced on the teenager and asked the prosecution to report back to the court to ensure that the order is carried out by the officers. The boy was 15 years old at the time he committed the offences against his friends and his younger sister. He was charged at the Sepang Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court for Children, on two counts of physical sexual assault and another charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature. He was also charged at the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court of Children, on one count of physical sexual assault. On September 23, 2020, the Sepang Magistrate’s Court ordered the teenager to be placed in Henry Gurney School for three years while the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court made the same order on February 4, 2021, after he pleaded guilty to all the charges. His appeal against the order was dismissed by the High Court on November 5, 2021, prompting him to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Lawyer Mohd Khairul Azam Abdul Aziz appeared for the teenager, while deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama "

Celebrity photo agency Backgrid USA Inc released a statement Thursday defending its freelance photographers who witnessed the alleged chase and denied that the pursuit caused multiple near-collisions on the streets of New York City. Backgrid claims it has reviewed photos and videos from four freelance photographers who were there that night, including three who travelled by car and one who was riding a bicycle. “It is important to note that these photographers have a professional responsibility to cover newsworthy events and personalities, including public figures,” Backgrid said in a statement provided to the L.A. Times. “According to the accounts given by these freelance contributors, they were covering the couple’s stay in New York City, including the possibility of a dinner after an awards ceremony. They had no intention of causing any distress or harm, as their only tool was their cameras. A few of the photos even show Meghan Markle smiling inside a cab.” The paparazzi working for Backgrid went so far as to accuse one of the vehicles in Harry and Meghan’s security escort of “driving in a manner that could be perceived as reckless”. The photo agency alleges that video footage shows the SUV “blocking off streets” and “being pulled over by the police”. (The New York Police Department confirmed with the L.A. Times on Thursday that officers “assisted the private security team protecting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex” that evening.) “We understand that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s security detail had a job to do, and we respect their work,” Backgrid said. “We do, however, want to point out that according to the photographers present, there were no near-collisions or near-crashes during the incident. The photographers have reported feeling that the couple was not in immediate danger at any point.” Still, the photo agency said it is “taking Prince Harry’s allegations seriously and will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter”. Another photographer-witness quoted separately by People magazine dismissed the Sussexes’ “sensational” claims as “crazy hyperbole”. “Nobody got a ticket or arrested,” the photographer told People. “I don’t see how it was near catastrophic.” The statement released Thursday by the duke and duchess tells a different, more harrowing story that many compared to the events leading up to the death of Harry’s mother. The prince has been vocal about his mission to protect his wife and children from suffering the same fate as his mother, who died in a 1997 car crash while her chauffeur was trying to evade paparazzi in Paris. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan deemed the paparazzi in New York “highly aggressive” and described the chase as a “relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours”. The former actor, her husband and her mother, were tailed by photographers while leaving the Woman of Vision Awards at the Ziegfield Ballroom, where Meghan was among the honorees. “While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone’s safety,” a representative for the Sussexes said. “Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained, encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all involved.” The chase allegedly included six blacked-out vehicles and resulted in several traffic violations, such as driving on the sidewalk, running red lights, reversing down a one-way street, driving while on the phone, driving while snapping photos and illegally blocking a moving vehicle. TMZ reported that one of the paparazzi vehicles drove the wrong way down a one-way street; Harry and Meghan’s car reached 129km per hour on the FDR Drive Highway in Manhattan. At one point, the duke and duchess abandoned their black SUV for a yellow New York taxi in an attempt to lose their pursuers. A cab driver – who said he transported the couple for about 10 minutes of their journey – later told The Washington Post that he felt safe during the trip and would not describe the incident as a chase. He did note, however, that photographers were following them “the whole time”. Representatives for Harry and Meghan did not immediately respond to the L.A. Times’ request for comment. – Bernama-dpa   "

On the first count, the accused, who at the time of the incident was the Malaysia Building Society Berhad (MBSB) manager, was charged with withdrawing RM220,000 belonging to MBSB using the name and password of another person, resulting in the company incurring losses. The charge was framed under Section 4 (1) of the Computer Crimes Act 1997, which carries a maximum fine of RM150,000 or a jail term of 10 years or both, upon conviction. On the second count, Muhamad Shahrul was accused of making an unauthorised modification of the MBSB Integrated Core Banking (MICOB) system data under Section 5 (1) of the same act, which provides for a fine not exceeding RM100,000 or a maximum jail sentence of seven years, or both if found guilty. He was also charged with committing CBT (amounting to RM220,000), under Section 408 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum of 14 years in jail, whipping, and a fine if convicted.

Taufik Goh Abdullah, 48, was not represented by a lawyer when he pleaded guilty to the charge while lying in a hospital bed, and he was subsequently convicted by the magistrate. The court proceedings were conducted in a hospital in Muar on February 4, 2020, in the presence of the magistrate, the deputy public prosecutor and the investigating officer where Taufik was admitted after he collapsed while being held in remand at the Muar police station and was taken to the hospital. In his appeal today, Taufik, a restaurant owner, questioned the validity of his plea of guilt and also contended that the magistrate did not follow the procedure under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Justice Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, chairing the three-man Court of Appeal bench dismissed Taufik’s appeal and ruled that his (Taufik’s) appeal against the conviction and custodial sentence imposed by the magistrate was safe. He (Justice Kamaludin) issued a warrant of committal for Taufik, who was present in court in a wheelchair, to begin his jail sentence starting from today. Taufik was allowed RM10,000 bail with one surety pending disposal of his appeal. Justices Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk Azimah Omar were the two other judges presiding with Justice Kamaludin. Two policemen were seen ushering Taufik into the court lock-up after the court delivered the decision. Taufik had pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of possessing stolen property — a Perodua Myvi 1.5 SE — belonging to Nurul Farha Pardi at his restaurant in Kluang, Johor, at 11pm on January 28, 2020. He was sentenced to six months jail, the minimum imprisonment sentence prescribed for the offence. He then filed an appeal to the High Court against his conviction and jail term but it was dismissed on December 19, 2021. On January 25, 2022, Taufik was granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence on three questions of law. The question concerned whether his plea of guilt taken was valid, whether there was a miscarriage of justice in the court proceedings and whether a binding-over order could be made instead of a custodial sentence. In today’s proceeding, Taufik’s lawyer G. Visvanathan Nair said his client was on medication at that time and could not decide on his own when he pleaded guilty to the charge and also his client did not understand the nature and consequences of the offence. He also urged the court to either order a retrial or give his client a bound for good behaviour. Deputy public prosecutor Samihah Rhazali, however, submitted that there was no procedural error when the magistrate accepted Taufik’s guilty plea, adding that Taufik was fully aware of the proceeding. — Bernama "

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali and Datuk See Mee Chun, will also decide on the same day over the prosecution’s appeal against the acquittal of another teenager for the offence without ordering him to enter his defence. Justice Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, who chaired the panel, said they are not prepared to deliver the decision today as they need to go through the oral and written submission by the prosecution and the defence. Earlier, the court heard the submission by deputy public prosecutor How May Ling and lawyer Haijan Omar over the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision to acquitting and discharging the second teenager, aged 22, for the offence without calling for his defence. The appeal by the first teenager against the High Court’s decision on August 17, 2020, which found him guilty and ordered him to be detained at the pleasure of the Yang-di-Pertuan Agong, was heard on March 9 this year. According to the charge, both teenagers, who were 16 years old then, together with another unidentified individual, were accused of murdering and causing the death of the 23 people staying at the tahfiz centre at Jalan Keramat Hujung, Kampung Datuk Keramat, Wangsa Maju here, between 4.15am and 6.45am on September 14, 2017. In today’s court proceeding, How urged the court to make an order for the second teenager to enter his defence on the charge. She said it was impossible for one person to cause the fire at the school as there were two gas tanks weighing 14kg each that were carried from the ground floor of the school to the second floor through the staircase. One gas tank was placed horizontally at the door and another one vertically and petrol was splashed on the door and fire was lit. “It is impossible for one person (to do it), it was done by two persons,” How added. She said circumstantial evidence showed there were four individuals seen at the back of the tahfiz school — the first and second teenager and two other male individuals who are brothers — with the first teenager and another unidentified individual entering the tahfiz school by climbing the fence at the back of the tahfiz school. Based on the CCTV recordings and the body shape of the second teenager, who was small and thin, he was able to go through the small opening of the barbed wire fence to enter the school compound, compared to the two brothers, How added. Meanwhile, Haijan, representing the two appellants, said there was no positive identification that the second teenager had entered the school, adding that they cannot rule out the two brothers from entering the school. He said there was also no evidence to show that the second teenager was involved in the crime, hence, no need for him to enter his defence. — Bernama "

Judge Izralizam Sanusi sentenced her to 10 years in prison for the offence of neglecting the girl and 12 years in prison for the second charge of abusing her. However, the court ordered her to serve the sentences concurrently from today, meaning she will be serving only 12 years in jail. The court also ordered the woman to sign a five-year good behaviour bond, with a local as a guarantor and a surety of RM5,000. Siti Bainun, who arrived at the court complex at 8.27am and accompanied by a woman, was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service to be completed within six months serving her time in jail. According to the charges, Siti Bainun was alleged to have neglected and abused a 13-year-old Down syndrome girl causing the victim to suffer physical and emotional injuries in a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju between February and June 2021. The charge, framed under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, provides imprisonment for up to 20 years or a fine of RM50,000 or both, upon conviction. Izralizam, in his judgment, said the act of neglect and abuse is a serious offence and as submitted by the prosecution, Parliament had approved the amendment to the criminal punishment by imposing a heavier punishment. He said the previous 10-year prison sentence had been increased to 20 years, while the fine had been increased from RM10,000 to RM50,000. “The amendment shows the intention of Parliament and the law is to ensure that severe punishment is given to offenders who commit the offence. “The punishment that is handed down needs to reflect the seriousness of the offence committed and show the public, especially parents, guardians and babysitters, not to take the safety and welfare of children lightly,” Izralizam added. He said the public interest factor also needed to be emphasised and in this case, the court found that Bella’s injury was a serious one that left a scar on her. “It not only left a scar in her but also physically. She was not only neglected by the accused to the extent that she suffered serious injuries but the accused was also found to be involved in abusing Bella. “The accused’s actions towards Bella are cruel and she needs to be given a severe punishment to teach a lesson not only to the accused but also to the community that this kind of crime should not be condoned. “The accused is a social activist who is often involved with children. The accused should have shouldered the responsibility as best as possible and not violate the trust given,” said the judge. Earlier during mitigation, Siti Bainun’s lawyer, Mohammad Farhan Maaruf, requested for a lighter sentence on the grounds that his client could change and should be given a second chance. “If a long prison sentence is imposed on the accused, it will prejudice the mothers who depend on her. The facilities in the prison also cannot accommodate the physical condition of the accused because of her large size and health problems,” he said. Mohammad Farhan requested the court to replace the prison sentence with the maximum fine for both charges against his client. “Throughout the trial, the accused has shown that she is a responsible person in which she has never failed to appear in court because of unreasonable reasons. “I also request the court to take into account that the accused is active in charity and volunteer work, besides considering that this is the accused’s first offence,” he said. Meanwhile, deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria said the accused had been convicted of a very serious offence of neglecting and abusing a child with disabilities. “A vulnerable and helpless child needs society and the law to protect their interests. The punishment must reflect the seriousness and gravity of the offence as a lesson to the public, especially parents, not to take children’s safety for granted,” he said. Zahida said the injuries suffered by Bella were serious with almost all of her body having burn scars, with some to remain for life. “It not only invites physical injury but also affects the victim’s emotions. The accused has been given a court order to care and look after Bella but she has abused the trust given to her by neglecting and ill-treating Bella,” she said. Meanwhile, Izralizam dismissed Siti Bainun’s application for a stay of the execution of the prison sentence pending her appeal at the High Court. The judge said Siti Bainun could not show special and exceptional circumstances for the court to allow a stay of the execution of her prison sentence. “The accused was found guilty in this court and there is no reason for me to suspend the prison sentence imposed on her. The factor that she is taking care of her mother is a personal matter. “The filing of an appeal by the defence attorney is not a justification to allow the application by the accused. In this case, justice can best be served through the immediate execution of the sentence. “Therefore, the accused’s application (for stay) is dismissed and the court ordered her to serve the prison sentence immediately,” he said. Siti Bainun, who appeared calm throughout the proceedings, will be sent to Kajang Prison to serve the sentence. — Bernama   "

Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, who chaired a three-member panel said they need a month’s time to go through relevant laws to consider the appropriate punishment for the male teenager. Justice Hadhariah together with Justices Datuk M. Gunalan and Datuk Lim Chong Fong heard the 18-year-old teenager’s appeal today against two magistrate’s court’s order that he be sent to Henry Gurney school for three years. The boy, who was 15 years old at the time of committing the offence, was charged at the Sepang Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court for Children for two counts of physical sexual assault and another charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature. He was also charged at the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court of Children, on a physical sexual assault charge. Two victims were his friends and one was his younger sister. On September 23, 2020, the Sepang Magistrate’s Court ordered the teenager to be placed in Henry Gurney School for three years while the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court made the same order on February 4, 2021, after the teenager pleaded guilty to all of the charges. His appeal against the sentence was dismissed by the High Court on November 5, 2021. Earlier in the court proceedings, Justice Hadhariah said the panel members had read the appeal records and had noted that the appellant (the teenager) had the tendency to watch pornography. Meanwhile, the teenager’s lawyer Mohd Khairul Azam Abdul Aziz argued that the magistrate had erred in issuing the order to send his client to Henry Gurney school as there was no such recommendation from the probation officer to do so. Mohd Khairul said under Section 91 (1) of the Child Act 2001, the court can give a non-custodial sentence like a bound over, make a probation order, community service or an order for the teenager to pay a fine, compensation or costs. He said the teenager has turn a new leaf and had completed his SPM examination. He said while studying at a boarding school, there were no complaints or reports of him repeating such offences. Deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee submitted that the teenager should be placed in Henry Gurney school and not be given a non-custodial sentence as the teenager has no regard for female modesty. She said a deterrent sentence should be imposed to send a message that the court shows abhorrence to those types of offences. Ng said the order of both magistrate’s courts to send the teenager to Henry Gurney School in Melaka was in accordance with the law, adding that the law allowed the teenager to be placed in the school until he turns 21. “The school, which is under the purview of the Director-General of Prisons is appropriate as it provided rehabilitation programmes,” she said adding that if the court did not agree with her that the teenager should be placed in the school, then the suitable sentence would be to commit him to a custodial sentence in prison. Ng said under the law, a probation order cannot be granted to the child if the offence committed were sexual offences. — Bernama "

Immigration Director-General Datuk Ruslin Jusoh said the couple was nabbed on Wednesday (April 12) when they turned up at the Kuala Lumpur Immigration headquarters to get a Malaysian passport for a Sri Lankan child. He said the Bahnu Internationals syndicate made use of poor Malaysian parents with children under 12 to get the passports. The syndicate would trick parents into bringing their child’s birth certificate to the immigration office on the pretext of wanting to make a passport for the kid. “However, during the application process at the immigration counter, a Sri Lankan almost the same age as the Malaysian child would be ushered to the counter instead to get their fingerprint and photograph taken. “Once completed, the husband and wife, who are the syndicate’s masterminds, would act as a ‘transporter’ by bringing the Sri Lankan child with a Malaysian passport to Europe,” Ruslin said in a statement today. The Immigration officer processing the passport application that day suspected something amiss when the guardian looked significantly different from the child, who could not speak Malay. He said it was learnt that the parents were paid RM500 for bringing their child to the Immigration office. Ruslin said initial investigations showed the syndicate received 30,000 to 50,000 euros for each Sri Lankan child taken to Europe on Malaysian passports. “Investigations are ongoing to find out how long this syndicate has been active and how many children were involved. “The couple, aged 37 and 26, were charged under Section 26A of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act (ATIPSOM) 2007 in the Sessions Court here today. “The Immigration Department would like to advise the public not to be easily manipulated by offers and lies from such syndicates. “Anyone with doubts on immigration matters can refer to the department or obtain the latest information through its website and official social media accounts,” he said. — Bernama "

Judge Rozilah Salleh also fined Andrew Mark Peters, 55, RM180,000 or 22 months in prison and Darren Anthony McNicholas, 51, was fined RM140,000 or 16 months in jail. Andrew was charged with two counts of being the mastermind of an international fraud syndicate who instructed Darren under the pseudonyms ‘David Henshaw’ and ‘Henry Paxton’ to deceive a Scottish citizen with guaranteed high profits from a short-term investment by purchasing shares in two non-existent companies. The charges were framed under Section 109 of the Penal Code read with Section 417 of the same code which provides for imprisonment of up to five years or a fine or both. Darren also faced two charges of cheating the same individual in relation to a similar offence under Section 417.

Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Fadhly Mohd Zamry asked for a sentence commensurate with the crime of two accused taking into account the public interest over their own interests. He said a sentence that is too low would send a message to Malaysians that the court did not take the offence seriously. “We have to take into account the frequency and the proliferation of fraud cases not only in Malaysia but all over the world.

Judge Datuk Azizul Azmi Adnan handed down the sentence on Radhakrishan Syam, Fazil Farook, Sainabdeen Siyad, Abdul Kalam Sajeev, and Salim Sabeer, aged 30 to 44, after finding that the defence failed to raise a reasonable doubt at the end of its case. According to the first and third charge, the five men, all plantation workers, were jointly charged with trafficking 1,510.17 grammes of Methamphetamine and 2,789.56 grammes of ketamine at a house in Kawasan Takau Mukim Linggi, Port Dickson, at about 6.30pm on August 3, 2018.

This was after Chong Chon Lang, 60, lost her appeal to set aside her conviction for the offence. However, the Court of Appeal bench comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk See Mee Chun and Datuk Azman Abdullah allowed Chong’s appeal to reduce her jail sentence from 12 years imprisonment to 12 months jail term. She said the 12 years imprisonment term meted out by the Sessions Court on Chong was manifestly excessive and the court also take into account of her age. Meanwhile, the court acquitted and discharged her husband Low Kee Pat, 62, of the same charges after ruling that he was not involved in the exploitation of the women who were Indonesian and Cambodian nationals. As for Chong, Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court’s decision, said the overall evidence showed that she (Chong) made use of her two maids to provide cleaning services to other people’s houses without paying them. On January 10, 2019, the Sessions Court found the couple guilty of exploiting a Cambodian woman, then aged 28, at a house in Taman Rawang Perdana, Rawang between May 13, 2010, and July 14, 2016, and the Indonesian maid, who was 30 years old then, in the same house between March 2015 and July 14, 2016. Both Chong and Low, a former contractor, were sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for each charge to run concurrently. They appealed to the High Court but they lost their appeal which was dismissed on May 29, 2020. In today’s proceeding, the couple’s lawyer Sreekant Pillai argued that the prosecution failed to prove the exploitation charges. He said his clients went through an agent to get the maids to work for them as domestic maids legally, adding that they were treated well and were paid salaries. Sreekant added that if the two maids were brought to clean just one or two other houses, it did not fall within the definition of exploitation and forced labour under Section 2 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act (ATIPSOM) 2007. He said the charges against his clients should not be under ATIPSOM but under the Immigration Act or under the Penal Code where the punishment is lower. Deputy public prosecutor Aznee Salmie Ahmad said under the terms of employment, the two women were only supposed to work at the couple’s house but instead, they were forced to clean other houses. She said the wife collected the money for the cleaning services and the maids did not receive any payment for the work. — Bernama "

According to a MACC source, the four men aged between 40 and 55 were arrested late yesterday afternoon at MACC headquarters here. Three of them were remanded for three days until March 17 after Magistrate Irza Zulaikha Rohanuddin granted the MACC’s application at Putrajaya Magistrate’s Court today, while the other was released on MACC bail. According to the MACC source, the sukuk was managed by a local bank to finance the project. All the expenses and earnings of the project had to be put into a designated special account, but the special account was later changed to another account which was believed to have been deliberately created in early 2022, suspected of avoiding repayment of the principal and profits to sukuk holders. The source said the act of creating another account would cause a loss of millions of ringgit to sukuk holders. It is understood that the concession agreement between the government and the appointed company for the implementation of the project was signed in July 2011 for a period of 12 years, and the sukuk is expected to reach maturity in May 2023. MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki when contacted confirmed the arrest but refused to comment further.

Judge Datuk Ahmad Bache fixed the date after listening to submissions from lawyer S. Devanandan representing Peter as the appellant and deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin. Earlier Devanandan argued that the letter regarding the M&E System maintenance and service contract at UMS was signed by the eighth prosecution witness (SP8), UMS deputy vice-chancellor (Academic & International) Prof Shariff Abdul Kadir S. Omang and not the appellant. “SP8 in his testimony confirmed that he signed the letter on behalf of UMS vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Mohamad Harun Abdullah (SP1), but SP1 in his testimony said that he had never authorised SP8 to sign the letter. “As such, the appellant is not involved in this matter and I request that the appellant’s appeal to set aside his conviction and sentence be allowed by the court,” he said. Wan Shaharuddin meanwhile, argued that the trial judge had examined that there was circumstantial evidence in convicting the accused, namely, who stands to gain if the maintenance project was awarded to any party and who had the opportunity to forge letters related to the project. “The trial judge found that the element of forgery was completed when the letter was handed over to the late Datuk Azlin Alias who was then principal private secretary to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. “This shows that the appellant (Peter) is the ‘maker’ of the letter and not SP8,” he said. According to Wan Shaharuddin, the appellant knew that the project was offered through an open tender but he had cheated and intended to hijack the project. “When defending himself, the accused himself admitted that it is a common practice to hijack projects in this country, even though they are offered through an open tender. This is very sad and as such, the prosecution urges the court reject the appellant’s appeal and uphold the conviction and sentence against him,” said Wan Shaharuddin. In June last year, Peter, 52, filed an appeal against the prison sentence and fine handed down by Sessions Court Judge Azura Alwi on May 26, 2022, after finding him guilty of the charge. Peter, as the managing director of Syarikat Asli Jati Sdn Bhd, was charged with falsifying a letter from the office of UMS deputy vice-chancellor dated June 9, 2014, which included false statements with the intention to deceive. The offence committed in the office of the principal private secretary to the prime minister at Perdana Putra building, Putrajaya between June 13 and Aug 21, 2014, was framed under Section 468 of the Penal Code which provides for a maximum prison sentence of seven years and a fine. The Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Malaysia (KDM) chief has paid the RM50,000 fine. — Bernama "

This was after a three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk See Mee Chun and Datuk Azman Abdullah dismissed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside a High Court’s decision which had acquitted and discharged Mohd Asrul Hisyam Setapa. Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court’s decision, held that there was no merits in the prosecution’s appeal. The prosecution had sought to restore the Sessions Court’s decision which had convicted and sentenced Mohd Arul to six years in jail and fined a total of RM236,000. Hanipah said that there was doubt regarding the type of burden of proof that the Sessions Court judge applied to convict Mohd Asrul, 36, on the charges. She said the Sessions Court judge also failed to state when the statutory presumption under Section 50 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act (MACC) 2009 was invoked against Mohd Asrul. Section 50 states that for anyone who faces charges under the MACC Act, it is proved that any gratification that has been received or given by or to the accused, the gratification shall be presumed to have been corruptly received or given unless the contrary is proven. Justice Hanipah said the Sessions Court’s decision to convict Mohd Asrul on the charges was bad in law. On July 30, 2018, the Sessions Court sentenced Mohd Asrul to six years in jail and fined him a total of RM236,000 after finding him guilty of the charges. On December 21, 2020, the High Court acquitted and discharged Mohd Asrul after allowing his appeal. Mohd Asrul was charged with allegedly accepting bribes in the form of goods and cash, totalling RM40,248.03, at several locations in Kota Bahru, Kelantan between April 4, 2016, and August 22, 2016.

Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Seri Abdul Jalil Hassan said the arrests were made last month and they are now being investigated by the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants (ATIPSOM). “These companies have licences to bring in foreign workers to work in Malaysia as domestic workers, construction labourers and farm workers. “However, they were found to have exploited their licence and exported Malaysians to work abroad such as Thailand and Myanmar until they were stranded there,” he said. He told reporters in a press conference following the return of five Malaysians who were victims of a job scam syndicate in Thailand, at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport here today. “Police will work with the Labour and Immigration Departments to find the masterminds of the syndicate. I believe these masterminds are in both countries (Malaysia and Thailand) and they are working together,” he said. Meanwhile, he reminded non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the next of kin of the victims to channel information to the Royal Malaysia Police (RMN) or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that the information from Malaysia to the Thai authorities is only through one official channel. “The issue of overlapping information is the biggest obstacle facing the Thai authorities. When we channel information to them, they are unsure whether they want to receive information from NGOs or RMN. The thing (information) is not synchronised. “So, we have decided that from now on only information channelled by the embassy or police-to-police will be accepted,” he said. He also reminded local folks to think hard before accepting a job offer abroad with a decent salary. “This should be a question mark when an outside company can offer them up to US$2,000 (about RM8,800) when they have no qualifications or any work experience. Please think twice even if it is offered from a legitimate employment agency,” he said. He said with the return of the five victims, RMN and the Royal Thai Police have managed to rescue 12 victims and are currently tracking the remaining 14 victims who are still stranded there. — Bernama "

Judge Datuk Azhar Abdul Hamid ruled that the five-year prison sentence meted out against Low, 60, also known as Repco Low, by the Sessions Court on February 29, 2016, was excessive. However, he upheld the RM5 million fine imposed on Low. “After examining the record of appeal and the written and oral submissions from both parties, I agree with the submissions of the respondent (prosecution) and the issues raised in this appeal. I find that the appellant’s (Low) conviction is safe. Therefore, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed,” said Judge Azhar. However, he allowed Low’s application to stay the execution of the prison sentence and fine pending an appeal at the Court of Appeal. “I allow the application for stay of the sentence and maintain the conditions of the previous bail, which is RM1.3 million bail and the passport to be handed over to the court,” Judge Azhar said. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Shoba Venu Gobal objected to the stay application by Low, represented by Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, saying that there were no special circumstances that required a stay. On February 29, 2016, Sessions Court Judge Mat Ghani Abdullah sentenced Low to five years in prison and fined him RM5 million after finding that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubts at the end of the prosecution’s case. However, the court granted Low a stay of execution pending an appeal at the High Court, and the bail was increased from RM300,000 to RM1.3 million. In 1999, Low was charged in the Sessions Court on a charge of instructing a representative of Sime Securities Sdn Bhd to buy Repco Holdings shares by absorbing any offer price of the shares offered by stock sellers on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. The act was deemed to have created confusion about the price of the shares on KLSE. Low, from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah was charged with committing the offence at Sime Securities, Level 21, Bangunan Sime Bank, Jalan Sultan Sulaiman, Kuala Lumpur, between 11am and 5pm on December 3, 1997. He was charged under Section 84(1) of the Securities Industry Act 1983, read together with Section 88(b) of the same law, which provides a minimum fine of RM1 million and imprisonment for up to 10 years, if found guilty. On November 14, 2006, Low was acquitted of the charge by the Sessions Court without his defence being called, but the prosecution made an appeal. On October 15, 2010, the High Court dismissed the prosecution’s appeal, and the latter filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal, which then ordered Low to enter his defence at the Sessions Court. — Bernama "

Lee Kum Loon, 58, lost his final appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence. A warrant of committal was issued by the three-member panel led by Justice Datuk Hanipah Farikullah for Lee to begin his jail sentence from today. He was previously released on a RM11,000 bail pending the hearing of his appeal. Justice Hanipah, who presided with Justices Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Lim Chong Fong, dismissed Lee’s appeal after ruling that his conviction for the offence was safe. Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision, said it was the court’s view there was no specific meaning to the term ‘trafficking’ in the Anti-Trafficking In Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (ATIPSOM) and the court referred to a Cambridge dictionary to get the meaning of the term ‘trafficking’. Justice Hanipah said that based on the overall evidence adduced in the court and the meaning of ‘trafficking’ in the dictionary, the court found that the element of section 2 of ATIPSOM has been fulfilled. She said according to the dictionary, the meaning of trafficking is an act of buying or selling people or of making money from work they are forced to do such as sex work. According to the charge, Lee committed the offence on the women, then aged 24 and 28, at Asia City Reflexology in Taman Perindustrian Axis, Shah Alam, Selangor at 6.15pm on July 31, 2018. On April 4, 2019, the Sessions Court found Lee guilty of the offence and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment. The High Court, on March 10, 2020, dismissed Lee’s appeal and increased his jail term to 10 years. This prompted him to file an appeal to the Court of Appeal. During the appeal hearing, Lee’s counsel Tan Choon Hong argued that the women were only employed to give body massage services and his client never forced them to provide sexual services. He said the women willingly offered sexual services, adding that the money for those services was given to them and that his client did not collect any money. Tan said the charge against his client under ATIPSOM was too harsh, adding that Lee could have been charged under the Penal Code or the Immigration Act. Deputy public prosecutor Fauziah Daud said the women were coerced by Lee to perform sexual acts which are considered sexual exploitation. She said the women’s willingness to perform sexual acts is not an element to be considered by the court. — Bernama "

The charge, framed under Section 377C of the Penal Code for committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature without consent, provides imprisonment for up to 20 years and shall also be liable to whipping, upon conviction. Tasnim ordered him to serve the jail sentence from the date of arrest, which was November 15, 2021, and to attend counselling sessions while in prison, and after serving his time, to be placed under police probation for two years.

Meanwhile, during mitigation, the accused, who was unrepresented, said he had no permanent job and was supporting two siblings, aged 18 and 20, who were still studying. Deputy public prosecutor Julaila Jamaludin, in requesting a punishment that is commensurate with the offence, said the accused was 18 years old when the offence was committed. “The Child Act still applies to the accused because, at the time of the incident, he was 18 years old and still a child. “Therefore, the prosecution requested a prison sentence and that he will have to undergo counselling sessions in prison in addition to being placed under police supervision for two years after completing his sentence,” she added. — Bernama "

Magistrate Nur Asyraf Zolhani fixed the new dates following an objection by Lew’s counsel Ram Singh against documents contained in a pendrive, which were findings of the prosecution’s seventh witness, a forensics expert, to be examined in the trial. “In view of the decision by this court, which covers quite extensively the documents, plus the calling of Insp Yip (seventh witness), it is pertinent that the defence will take this matter to the High Court for revision. “The defence is asking for a stay of proceedings and not to call Insp Yip until the disposal of the revision at the High Court, which will be done expeditiously,” said Ram Singh in the proceeding at the Tenom Magistrate’s Court here today. Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Zahida Zakaria objected to a stay of proceedings, saying that the prosecution was ready to examine Yip and tender the documents as exhibits. Nur Asyraf said in the interest of justice and in order not to render the revision academic, he would allow the stay of proceedings until the revision was heard and disposed of. “As such, the court will allow the seventh prosecution witness Insp Yip Chang Ching to testify. However, the defence counsel will also have the right to a reasonable time to examine the documents and to recall or re-summon and examine any witness in relation to the documents,” he said. Yip was expected to testify with regard to 90 images contained in a pendrive that he had extracted from the accused’s handphone. Lew, 37, faces 11 charges, including defaming a woman in her 40s by sending obscene words and pictures to the victim’s phone number via the WhatsApp application between March and June last year. The charge was framed under Section 509 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years, a fine, or both if convicted.

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Abd Jalil Hassan said any information channelled by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to the Cambodian authorities will not be entertained from today, as it was feared to interfere with rescue efforts. He said the agreement was reached following discussions between the Cambodian authorities and a delegation from the PDRM and Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Cambodia led by him. “Through discussions with the Cambodian authorities, it was found that the information channelled by the NGO had interfered with the rescue process because the victims had been taken into hiding by the syndicate,” he said during a press conference with five rescued victims at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, here, today. Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Protocol and Consular chief Mohd Aini Atan was also present. Meanwhile, Abd Jalil said the discussions with the Cambodian authorities also found that some of the claims by NGOs here about the condition of the victims were unfounded. “The video of syndicate victims being abused and forced to eat pork does not involve Malaysians, the video was deliberately spread by the syndicate members to scare the victims’ relatives into paying money to free their children or family members,” he said. In addition, he said that not all individuals who were rescued and brought back to Malaysia were victims of syndicates, because there were cases of individuals deliberately claiming to be victims to run away from debts due to gambling, and some even returned to work in Cambodia after being rescued. Abd Jalil advised NGOs to be more careful when issuing statements regarding the issue to avoid straining the relationship between the two countries. Meanwhile, Abd Jalil said that as of yesterday, PDRM had received a total of 262 police reports involving 330 victims of the job scam syndicate stranded abroad, with 218 of them rescued, and efforts were underway to bring the rest back home. — Bernama "

Siti Bainun, 31, said an examination carried out by Dr Meenambigai PK Sevarajah at the Emergency and Trauma Department of Kuala Lumpur Hospital, found that Bella’s lungs, abdomen and legs were in good and normal condition. “Bella is very, very healthy. She does not have asthma or any illness. This finding shows that I have never stepped on and kicked her stomach, or ordered her to stand for a long period and the abuses that the prosecution witnesses fabricated had never happened. In fact, Bella’s legs were reported not to be swollen,” she said when reading her witness statement on the second day of her defence trial before Judge Izralizam Sanusi. Meanwhile, Siti Bainun said the bite marks on Bella’s stomach were caused by a fight between the teenager and a former resident of Rumah Bonda known as Balqis over a facial wash. She said after both girls bit each other, she rubbed ‘minyak gamat’ (sea cucumber ointment) and put cream on the bite marks, saying that Bella and Balqis had a love-hate relationship. On the burn marks suffered by Bella caused by hot water from a thermos during another fight with Balqis in May 2021, Siti Bainun said due to the Covid-19 pandemic, she bought medicine to treat the burn marks based on the advice provided by the clinic and pharmacy, adding that the wounds healed within a month except those on Bella’s wrists. According to her, she took Bella to a nearby clinic for further treatment. “I did not abuse Bella. If I intended to hurt Bella, I would not try to heal her (wounds), there was no need for me to ask the pharmacist for the right medicine to treat her and spend money to buy all the necessary items and the best medicines,” she said, adding that she had provided the best treatment for Bella as a mother and a normal person would have done for her child. On the allegation that she treated Yasmin like a slave, Siti Bainun said she had no idea where it came from, adding that this allegation was to influence the court and the people apart from making the ‘storytelling’ on social media juicier. Siti Bainun said Yasmin was like her own child and from Yasmin’s diary, it was clear that the teenager loved her and her younger siblings at the welfare home. “We lived simply. If there was extra money, I would buy them the food that they wanted, also jewellery, including for Yasmin. “Yasmin fabricated a twisted tale about me in this court, (but) I still love her. She was one of the first teenagers that I saved and in my care. I know she and her father were threatened that Yasmin will be the scapegoat,” she added. On November 24 last year, the judge ordered Siti Bainun to enter her defence on two charges of neglecting and abusing Bella after the prosecution managed to establish a prima facie case against her at the end of the prosecution case. Siti Bainun, 30, was alleged to have committed the offence in a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju between February and June 2021. The charges were framed under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001 which carries imprisonment for up to 20 years or a fine of RM50,000 or both, if found guilty. The trial continues on February 20. — Bernama "

He said Tan’s conviction for trafficking in the drugs was not safe. However, he said there was sufficient evidence for possession of the drugs. Tan was found guilty on two counts of trafficking in the drugs by the Johor Bahru High Court on June 17, 2020, and was sentenced to death.

Earlier, Mohd Ismail’s lawyer Datuk Wan Azmir Wan Majid said the High Court and the Court of Appeal had used the balance of probabilities burden, which is a lower burden of proof when convicting Mohd Ismail on the charges. He said the previous appellate court panel had decided that the prosecution was only required to prove the elements of money laundering charges against Mohd Ismail on a balance of probabilities instead of beyond reasonable doubt, which is a higher burden of proof that is usually applied to criminal cases. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar, who was assisted by DPP Mohd Fairuz Johari, countered by saying that Mohd Ismail had failed to meet the requirement for review, adding that all the issues had been ventilated by the previous Court of Appeal panel.

He was also ordered to go for rehabilitation counselling for three years and to be placed under police supervision for three years after he completes serving his jail term.

Dinesh, 28, a tow truck worker, of the drug trafficking charge. Meanwhile, Iranians Shervin Khoshhal Sarvandani, 30, owner of a shop selling home decorations, and Mohammad Mahdi Tyhim Nazlo, 32, a clothing boutique owner, had been each sentenced to 18 years jail and 10 strokes of the cane after they pleaded guilty to a lesser charge for drug possession. According to the prosecution’s case, the three men were arrested when police, acting on information about a drug processing activity, raided a fish breeding centre at Behrang Station, near Tanjung Malim, Perak. There was a strong chemical smell coming from the direction of a container cabin where two Middle Eastern-looking men were seen cooking something and police also found several pieces of equipment and substances, believed to be used to process drugs.

Judge Azizul Azmi Adnan meted out the punishment on Abdul Malik Rosli, 24, after finding that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubts against the prosecution’s case. He said he had thoroughly examined the evidence presented by the defence and concluded that the prosecution had established a case under Section 302 of the Penal Code. Abdul Malik was charged with the murder of Mahussin Abdul Rahim, 28, on the fourth floor of the Lukut health quarters in Port Dickson at around 1.40am on January 19, 2018. Mahussin’s body was found by his friend 72 hours after he was reported missing when he failed to turn up for work on January 22, 2018.

In mitigation, lawyer Datuk Haniff Hasan, representing the accused, said it was not a premeditated crime, but that his client got out of control due to emotional stress and urged the court to take into account the accused’s background. “He was 20 years old at the time, still and with no steady job, and came from a poor family. His family was not present today because they could not afford to come to court,” he said. Hanif said the defence will appeal the decision. — Bernama "

He was accused of committing the offence at the Triang Commercial Centre in Bera, Pahang, at 9.45pm on July 1, 2013. Sanjeevanfiled an appeal to the Court of Appeal after losing his appeal at the Temerloh High Court on November 27, 2020. In the Court of Appeal’s decision, Justice Ahmad Nasfy, who chaired the panel, said Sanjeevan was denied a fair trial as the prosecution did not call or offer to the defence, seven witnesses who were present at the crime scene. He said there was also a miscarriage of justice as the investigating officer did not record Sanjeevan’s statement. Justice Ahmad Nasfy added the magistrate had misdirected herself when she held there was positive identification of the appellant (Sanjeevan).

After the wrappings were opened, we found three pieces of furniture in the shape of a table with frames made of iron and wood. “Our officers then unwrapped one of the furniture and removed the top part of the table and found clear crystalline substance suspected to be ketamine with an estimated weight of 124.6 kg worth RM6.8 million in the furniture,” he said at a press conference at JKDM headquarters narcotics branch here, today. Initial investigations revealed the merchandise, which was from an industrial park in Selangor, was diverted to Johor Bahru before being taken to the warehouse of the air cargo delivery agent at KLIA to evade detection. The activity was believed to be handled by an international syndicate aided by locals. Abdul Halim said following the discovery, two local men aged between 30 and 40 were detained to assist in the investigations. Meanwhile, JKDM also seized an international parcel (outbound) containing two bathrobes to be sent to a country in the Oceania region. The parcel is suspected to contain methamphetamine at the Pos Malaysia Cargo International Hub (PMIH) estimated to weigh 3.76 kg worth RM135,000 on October 12. “We believe the sender’s information is false to avoid detection in addition to the modus operandi used which is to dissolve the drugs by soaking it with a bathrobe,” he said. Abdul Halim said both cases will be investigated under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. — Bernama   "

This was after S. Soosai, 34, succeeded in his appeal at the Court of Appeal to set aside his murder conviction and death sentence. In allowing Soosai’s appeal, Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail who led a three-member panel ruled that there was no direct or circumstantial evidence that Soosai had caused B. Sugumaran’s death. In the court’s unanimous decision, she said the court agreed with the submission by Soosai’s counsel, Afifuddin Ahmad Hafifi that it was not known what was the actual information that Soosai gave to police. Justice Hadhariah said Soosai’s act of pointing to where the deceased body was buried did not mean that he had caused his death. Sitting with Justices Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali and Datuk Hashim Hamzah, she held that Soosai’s conviction for murder was not safe. On February 17, 2020, the Seremban High Court sentenced Soosai to death after finding him guilty of killing Sugumaran, 34, at a Christian cemetery in Kampung Saga Rantau, Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan between 6pm on September 13, 2017, and 6.30pm on November 11, 2017. According to the prosecution’s case, the deceased was seen following two men in a car on September 13, 2017, and his elder brother subsequently made a police report the next day after failing to contact or find him. On November 6, 2017, police arrested Soosai and during interrogation, he purportedly gave information that the deceased body was in a seaside area. After leading police to the place, Soosai purportedly said that he actually buried the deceased’s body at a Christian cemetery. The police team then went to the cemetery and found the body after Soosai showed them where it was buried. DNA analysis was carried out, with the deceased identified as Sugumaran. Soosai, who gave an unsworn statement, denied he told police the deceased’s body was buried in the cemetery, or that he had killed the deceased. He said did not have the motive to kill the deceased as he did not know him or had met him. Soosai said he gave information that the body was buried at Pantai Chuah as he could not take the threats and beatings by police. Deputy public prosecutor Wong Poi Yoke, appearing for the prosecution, submitted that the evidence against Soosai was circumstantial as he had the knowledge of where the body was placed. — Bernama "

A Court of Appeal three-man panel led by Justice Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, in acquitting and discharging Ben Khaled Abd Molok, ruled the drug trafficking conviction against him was not safe. He said there was a misdirection by the High Court judge in not considering the prosecution’s failure to ensure the attendance of a material witness that had been offered to the defence after the court ordered Ben Khalid to enter his defence. The other two judges were Justices Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Hashim Hamzah. Ben Khaled, who is paralysed from the waist down, was found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court on August 17, 2020, for trafficking in the drug at a car workshop in Jalan Tago, Taman Perindustrian Tago, Sri Damansara, Gombak, Selangor at 4pm on February 12, 2019. Meanwhile, the 42-year-old man, who was in a wheelchair, withdrew his appeal against his conviction, a three years jail sentence and three strokes of the rotan for possession of 0.73 grammes of nimetazepam. He had completed the jail term, but was brought back to prison as he had yet to be whipped. His lawyer Afiffuddin Ahmad Hafifi said due to his client’s current condition, a medical officer had to certify that Ben Khaled is fit before the whipping sentence could be executed on him. Section 291 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the court may in its discretion substitute the whipping sentence of an offender to imprisonment, he added. According to Ben Khaled’s other lawyer, Hafizuddin Salehuddin, Ben Khaled became paralysed in 2020 due to tuberculosis which affected his spine. Justice Kamaludin then told Ben Khaled’s lawyers that their client could go back to the High Court to seek further direction or substitution for the whipping sentence if he is certified to be unfit.

He was ordered to serve the sentence from April 17, 2017, the date of his arrest. A three-man panel comprising Justices Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, Datuk P. Ravinthran and Datuk Hashim Hamzah allowed his appeal after finding that based on evidence, Mohamed Rosli’s conviction for murder was not safe. Justice Kamaludin, who was chairing the panel, said the High Court judge failed to consider Mohamad Rosli’s entire defence that he was provoked. Mohamad Rosli was sentenced to death by the Temerloh High Court on October 22, 2019, after he was found guilty of killing Devadas. According to the evidence, Mohamad Rosli and the deceased always quarrelled as the former disliked the deceased’s cooking and the deceased also accused Mohamad Rosli of not keeping food for him. Both of them and another worker were staying in a house (quarters) provided by their employer. Earlier, Mohamad Rosli’s lawyer S. Sundarajan argued that a fight broke out after a grave and sudden provocation by the deceased and that both were in a state of intoxication when the fight took place.

A three-member panel comprising Court of Appeal judges Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and High Court judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan allowed Tan Chen Xing’s appeal after finding that there was merit in his appeal. In the court’s decision, Justice Kamaludin, who led the panel, said Tan’s conviction for drug trafficking was not safe to be upheld as the High Court judge did not make comprehensive findings on the evidence. The court also set aside Tan’s conviction and jail sentences for the other two charges of possessing 0.06 grammes of nimetazepam and for the possession of 299.2 grammes of phenazepam poison without a valid licence. For the drug trafficking charges, Tan was charged with trafficking 361.8 grammes of ketamine and 156.52 grammes of methamphetamine. Tan was accused of committing the offences at a condominium in Lebuh Minden 1 Gelugor, Penang at 4pm on November 10, 2016. In 2020, the Penang High Court found Tan guilty of the offences. He was sentenced to death for trafficking the drugs. For possessing nimetazepam, Tan was sentenced to two years in jail and received a one-year imprisonment for possessing phenazepam. Tan’s lawyer Hussaini Abdul Rashid argued that the High Court judge failed to consider that there were five people who stayed in the condominium and that his client was not the only person who had access to the condominium. He said Tan stayed in the third room of the condominium and not in the first room where the drugs were found. Hussaini said his client will have to go back to prison to receive 10 strokes of the cane before he could be released, as he was sentenced to five years in jail and 10 strokes of the cane by a Sessions Court after he pleaded guilty to possessing the drug in his pocket. He said Tan had completed serving his jail sentence but had not yet received the whipping. Deputy public prosecutors K. Mangai and Khairul Aisamuddin Abdul Rahman appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama "

This followed a decision by a three-member panel of the Court of Appeal in dismissing the appeal by Gan Kiat Bend, 64, to set aside his conviction, as well as the jail sentence and fine. In the court’s decision, Justice Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, chairing the panel, said there was no merit in Gan’s appeal and there was also no appealable error by the lower court to warrant the appellate court’s intervention. The two other judges were Justices Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali. Gan, who was on bail of RM170,000 pending disposal of his appeal, was ordered by the Court of Appeal to begin his jail sentence today after the court issued a warrant of committal against him.

On December 23, 2010, the Sessions Court sentenced him to five years in jail and a RM1 million fine, in default one year in jail for the first charge and two years in jail for the second charge. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment for the third charge and two years jail for the fourth charge. However, Gan was ordered to serve the jail sentences concurrently, meaning he would only have to serve five years in jail. The Sessions Court also ordered Gan to pay a RM2.4 million penalty or levy under Section (2) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing Act 2001. Failing to pay the penalty within a year will land him with another jail term. His appeal at the High Court was dismissed on March 10, 2017. Gan settled the RM1 million fine but did not pay the RM2.4 million penalty. He was initially charged together with another unlicensed land broker Ismail Hussin, who is now deceased. Gan was represented by lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, while deputy public prosecutor Datuk Dusuki Mokhtar, Nahra Dollah and Samihah Rhazali prosecuted. — Bernama "

In a unanimous decision delivered by Justice Abu Bakar, the court ordered Abdul Azeez’s trial on the nine charges to resume in the Sessions Court. Justice Abu Bakar, who read the court’s unanimous decision, however, allowed Abdul Azeez’s appeal to partly nullify four of the money-laundering charges. Abdul Azeez was charged at the Sessions Court with three counts of accepting bribes amounting to RM5.2mil in connection with road projects in Perak and Kedah and 10 counts of money laundering involving a total of RM13.9mil which he allegedly received from Menuju Asas Sdn Bhd.

In the court’s decision, Justice Abu Bakar acquitted and discharged Abdul Azeez on the third, seventh, eighth and ninth charges, which were for money laundering, after striking out those charges as they did not state the exact location where the offences were allegedly committed, but merely stating in the Klang Valley. He also said there was no political prosecution against the 55-year-old Baling Member of Parliament. Justice Abu Bakar also disagreed with Abdul Azeez’s argument that the charges filed against him were mala fide (done in bad faith).

Negeri Sembilan police chief Datuk Ruslan Khalid said during the 5.30pm raid carried out by a team from the D9 division of the state police headquarters, three Myanmar nationals were detained and 22,848 cans of alcohol and equipment used for processing the alcohol worth RM182,784 was seized. He said in a follow-up operation, two local men were also detained on August 30 and all the suspects would be remanded to assist in investigations. “The suspects are believed to have been using an abandoned factory for almost two years to process alcohol illegally, namely canned beer with a high content of alcohol (16 to 18 per cent) for brand names like DJ Premium Strong Beer, Brew Extra Larger Manblo, Hades Beer Extra Strong Beer and Oi Premium Strong Beer. “We believe a complete alcohol processing procedure has been carried out, right from manufacturing to packing and distribution. This contraband alcohol is produced for the local and international market with prices ranging from RM5 to RM10 a can,” Ruslan told reporters at the factory earlier today. The modus operandi of the suspects is to identify an isolated abandoned factory for their operation and use foreign workers to carry out the operation to avoid being detected by the authorities. He said the Myanmar nationals whose passports had expired, only used the back door for entry and exit and added that initial investigations revealed that the owner of the factory had passed away. — Bernama   "

A three-member Court of Appeal panel comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk See Mee Chun allowed Muhammad Arfahsyar Ishak’s final appeal to set aside his conviction and sentence for the offence. Justice Hadhariah, who delivered the court’s decision, acquitted and discharged Muhammad Arfahsyar after ruling that the victim was not a credible witness as there were material contradictions in her evidence during the trial. His lawyer G. Ravishankar submitted in court that the victim, now 23, was not a credible witness as she had made a police report to withdraw her complaint which was lodged in 2019. He said she had also sent a text message to his client seeking forgiveness, adding that the first report was made in hopes that Muhammad Arfahsyar would marry her. Ravishankar said the girl told a doctor who examined her that the first police report was lodged as Muhammad Arfahsyar had found a new girlfriend and was not replying to her text messages. The 31-year-old man (Muhammad Arfahsyar) was charged with raping the girl who was then 15 years and nine months old at a hotel in Bedong, Kedah at 3pm on April 5, 2014. He was found guilty by the Sessions Court on November 13, 2017, and sentenced to 15 years’ jail and six strokes of the rotan. On December 19, 2018, the High Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction but reduced his sentence to eight years and five strokes of the rotan.

Rosmah will also have to pay a fine of RM970 million (US$216.45 million) over three bribery charges, Kuala Lumpur High Court Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan said, adding that the prosecution proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge granted her a stay of sentence, so Rosmah will not go to jail on Thursday. She can appeal the decision in two higher courts. Rosmah, dressed in a yellow baju kurung — a traditional Malaysian long blouse and skirt — and matching headscarf, addressed the judge tearfully immediately after the verdict. “I must admit that I am very sad with what happened today,” she said. “Nobody saw me taking the money, nobody saw me counting the money…. but if that is the conclusion, I leave it to God.” Her lawyers had asked for a one-day jail sentence, while prosecutors sought “maximum or near maximum.” The former first lady, seen as a powerful figure behind Najib, has been widely scorned in Malaysia for her extravagant lifestyle and penchant for Hermes Birkin bags. Rosmah, 70, had pleaded not guilty to the three charges of soliciting and receiving bribes between 2016 and 2017 to help a company secure a US$279 million (RM1.24 billion) solar power supply project from Najib’s government. Prosecutors say Rosmah sought a bribe of RM187.5 million (US$41.80 million) and received RM6.5 million from an official of the company that won the project. Rosmah has argued that she was framed by her former aide as well as several government and company officials involved in the project. Rosmah also faces 17 charges of money laundering and tax evasion in a separate case. Najib and his wife, who has faced criticism for her lavish lifestyle, are at the centre of a wide-ranging crackdown on corruption mounted after defeat in a historic 2018 election ended Najib’s nine years in power. Last week, Najib began serving a 12-year jail sentence after Malaysia’s top court upheld his conviction in a case linked to a multibillion-dollar graft scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). He remains on trial in four other corruption cases. Najib was voted out of power amid public outrage over the 1MDB scandal, which is the subject of corruption and money laundering investigations in at least six countries. The United States’ Department of Justice alleges that US$4.5 billion (RM20.1 billion) were stolen from 1MDB, about US$1 billion (RM4.48 billion) of which made their way into Najib’s personal bank accounts. Some of the funds stolen from 1MDB were used to buy jewellery for Rosmah, including a US$27 (RM120.9 million) million pink diamond necklace, US lawsuits say. Police found 12,000 individual items of jewellery, 567 luxury handbags, 423 watches and $26 million (RM116.4 million) in cash at properties linked to the couple following Najib’s unexpected defeat in the 2018 election. — Reuters   "

The PKR central leadership council member also said that the PKR Johor Bahru branch office in Larkin here, which also acts as the Johor Bahru constituency’s service centre, was torched at around 6am. “Based on closed circuit TV (CCTV) footage and inspections at the location, the incident was an act of mischief and sabotage with five tyres being placed in front of the office and torched. “I am unsure whether the threats and the arson involve the same individual, but to claim both are just coincidences is odd due to the timing,” he told reporters at the office here today.

As of mid-August 2022, Malaysia is among the top five countries in Apac including Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia and Taiwan to accumulate 61.1 per cent of the total malicious emails detected by Kaspersky Mail Antivirus. Vietnam tops the list of the most spam emails detected with a total of 3.09 million emails, followed by Malaysia (2.36 million), Japan (1.86 million), Indonesia (1.80 million) and Taiwan (1.45 million). Kaspersky Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) senior security researcher Noushin Shabab said the Apac region accounts for almost 24 per cent of total global malicious emails detected this year. “The Apac region has almost 60 per cent of the world’s population. This means there are more potential victims for scammers here compared to other parts of the world,” she said in a presentation during Kaspersky’s 8th APAC Cyber Security Weekend here today. “The extensive use of online services such as online shopping and other online platforms for day-to-day activities here also makes individuals more susceptible to falling victim to scams,” Noushin said. She added there are three main factors — its population, the high adoption of e-services, and the pandemic lockdowns — caused the bulk of spam emails targeting Apac. “There is also the lingering pandemic aftermath which led to lockdowns and work-from-home set up in the region where people took their work computers home. “Home networks are usually less protected from cyberattacks,” Noushin said. Nevertheless, she noted that the number of malicious spam mails detected by Kaspersky solutions has seen a gradual decline after its peak in 2019. “These malicious emails were mostly sent by cybercriminals in the form of mass email to reach more users, with the intention of making financial gains for the attacker. “Our constant monitoring of the current and new advanced persistent threats operating in Apac showed that the majority of these notorious threat actors use targeted phishing called spear phishing to crack into an organisation’s systems,” Noushin said. — Bernama "

A three-man panel comprising Justices Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Hashim Hamzah also affirmed the 10-year jail sentence imposed on Luqman Hadi Mustapa by the High Court for attempting to murder two siblings. Justice Nordin, who delivered the court’s decision, said the burden was on Luqman to prove his defence of legal insanity under Section 84 of the Penal Code on a balance of probabilities. Section 84 states that nothing is an offence which is done by a person, who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. He said it was the trial judge to decide whether the defence of legal insanity was proven or not based on the facts of the case adding that the court found that the High Court had rightly decided in dismissing the defence of legal insanity in the case and it was supported by the law. An accused person must show both medical and legal insanity in order to plead an unsound mind. Justice Nordin said Luqman’s conviction for the offences was safe and that his (Luqman’s) appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed. Luqman, 33, was appealing against the decision by the Melaka High Court on August 16, 2019, to sentence him to death after finding him guilty of murdering his foster mother’s sister Mariah Baharim, 61, her husband Hassan A. Wahab, 70, and their 22-year old son Muhammad Taufeq. The High Court also found Luqman guilty on two charges of attempting to murder the couple’s daughters Noor Haslinda Diyana, 26, and Nur Aqedah Aeina, 24, and sentenced him to 10 years in jail, which to run concurrently, on each of the two charges. He was accused of committing the offences at a house in Jalan Sidang Said in Bertam Malim, Melaka between 5.50am and 6.15am on August 25, 2016. In his decision, then High Court judge Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin (now Court of Appeal judge) said Luqman’s actions were inconsistent with that of an individual who had an unsound mind, in view of the fact that his grandmother was unharmed in the incident and that he had first attacked the men before turning on his female relatives. During the trial at the High Court, 25 witnesses testified for the prosecution. When the court ordered Luqman to enter his defence, he opted to remain silent. The deputy director of Hospital Permai in Johor was called as a witness in the trial to tender a report by a psychiatrist who had examined Luqman as the psychiatrist had passed away. Luqman has one more avenue to appeal, that is to the Federal Court. Luqman was represented by lawyers Azrul Zulkifli Stork, Mohd Fahmy Sulaiman and Azalea Nazihah Zulkifli while deputy public prosecutors Nurul Farhana Khalid and Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama "

He said the trend of cybercrimes from 2016 till July 2022 showed an increase from 39 per cent to 61 per cent. There are six types of scams namely Macau Scam, e-commerce crimes, non-existent loans, non-existent investments, 419 scams or love scams and phishing. Macau Scam or impersonation/fraud calls have so far chalked up 4,912 cases involving a loss of RM199.8 million; e-commerce crimes recorded 5,397 cases with a loss of RM71.6 million; and e-financial fraud or phishing as many as 543 cases with a loss of RM40.5 million,” Victor said. He said this in a webinar titled ‘Duit dalam akaun bank anda lesap. Apakah puncanya dan langkah mencegahnya’. Victor said money in bank accounts that goes missing happens through phishing and the internet apart from the banks offering online services. So what scammers do is create a website that looks similar to the respective banks. “In line with the development of technology, scammers come up with ‘app scams’. This is one of the phishing tactics used by scammers to get names, passwords, and information about the user,” he said. Victor said after the user uploads this ‘app scam’, the application will ask to take over the role of the short message service (SMS) and if the user allows this then it makes it easier for scammers to carry out activities. He said among the modus operandi scammers commonly use are advertisements on social media platforms – app scams recorded a total of 39 cases involving losses of RM721,728.69 by certain individuals from January to July 2022. Meanwhile, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) manager (inquiries and complaints division), Vijayadurai Singgatore said BNM always urges the public to be aware of tricks or offers made by scammers, whether they are logical or not. “We have to use technology wisely, do not trust the application given through WhatsApp, do not click the hyperlink given and make a transaction, it might be a trap,” he said. BNM and the banking industry also constantly improve security standards so that users are confident in the security of the system offered. “Now internet banking is further fortified with CAPTCHA with pictures to be matched by users. “In the meantime, there are many banks that have increased the level of security by creating device binding, which means that if users want to do internet banking, they must use a registered device,” Vijayadurai also said. AmBank Islamic Bhd chief executive officer Eqhwan Mokhzanee Muhammad said if users are involved in scam activities, they should contact the bank first so that their accounts can be frozen immediately before making a police report. “When the customer suspects that he has been cheated, and sees that the money is missing, I suggest the customer contacts the bank on the customer service line and at the same time I urge the customer to change the ATM card pin number and also the internet banking access password,” he added. — Bernama "

A three-man panel of the Court of Appeal comprising Justices Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali also ordered Mohammud Rezwan Zuhaimi to be whipped four times. Justice Abdul Karim, who led the panel, ordered Mohammud Rezwan, 26, to serve his jail sentence from November 17, 2019, the date of his arrest. In delivering the decision, he said the offences committed by Mohammud Rezwan, 26, were serious and that such crimes were rampant. He said the Sessions Court and High Court had committed an error in imposing lighter sentences, adding that the offences committed by Mohammud Rezwan took place at different places and times and involved different victims. Justice Abdul Karim also said the court was using its discretion to impose one stroke of the rotan on Mohammud Rezwan for each of the four charges. The panel allowed the prosecution’s appeal for the three-year jail sentence meted out on Mohammud Rezwan for each of the four charges to run consecutively instead of concurrently. On November 26, 2019, Mohammud Rezwan pleaded guilty at the Seremban Sessions Court to the four charges of robbing with parang four Seven-Eleven stores in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan on November 1, 2019, November 9, 2019, November 13, 2019 and November 14, 2019. For the first count, he robbed Nureirana Muhamad Taufed at the 24-hour convenience store at Jalan Tuanku Antah Rahang and escaped with cash of RM110 and cigarettes worth RM336.26 and on the second count, he robbed Mohamad Naqi Fitri Sahudin at another convenience store at Jalan Tun Dr Ismail of RM160 cash and cookies and cigarettes valued at RM216.10. On the third count, Mohammud Rezwan robbed Khairunnisa Azman at the same store at Jalan Tuanku Antah and fled with RM150 and for the fourth count, he robbed Ahmed Md Foysal at a convenience store at Jalan Tuanku Munawir Seremban and fled with RM186.45 cash and food items. The Sessions Court sentenced him to one year’s jail for each count with the sentences to run concurrently, which means he would have to serve only one year’s imprisonment. However, on May 5 last year, following an appeal by the prosecution, the High Court increased his jail term to three years’ imprisonment for each count, to run concurrently. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Zaki Asyraf Zubir asked for the three-year jail sentences to run consecutively, saying the offences committed involved different victims and at different places and times. Lawyer Joseph Mathews, who was appointed by the National Legal Aid Foundation to represent Mohammud Rezwan, however, urged the court not to disturb the lower court’s decision as his client was almost finished serving his jail term and would be released next week. — Bernama "

Hussein said the syndicate’s modus operandi was to offer victims a job that promised a lucrative salary at call centres in Cambodia via social networking sites such as Facebook and WeChat. “When they (Malaysians) arrive there (Cambodia), the situation is not like what they have been promised. The victims then realised they have been deceived but were not allowed to return to Malaysia. “There are also victims who claimed to have received threats and been physically abused,” he said, adding the possibility of Malaysians colluding with such syndicates in Cambodia has not been ruled out.

Hussein said most of the victims found themselves stranded in Cambodia which accounts for 40 per cent of the total cases, followed by Myanmar and Laos.

MyCC chief executive officer Iskandar Ismail said the companies had formed two cartels to manipulate four information technology projects involving the National Academy of Arts, Culture and Heritage (Aswara)
worth RM1.92 million. He said investigations were conducted since 2017 after a complaint by Aswara, before a thorough review by the MyCC revealed breaches by the eight companies that violated Section 4(1), which is read together with Section 4(2) of the Competition Act 2010. “This is because of their involvement with a series of anti-competition agreements or bid rigging involving Aswara procurement projects. “All the companies were colluding to defraud the government and manipulate tenders to win (tenders and government procurement invoices),” he said at a media conference at the MyCC office here today. Iskandar said the public procurement procedure was set to ensure competitive bids from bidders and companies were required to act responsibly. He said interested bidders had to prepare and hand in their offer independently of each other and tenders or invoices produced based on secret arrangements or cooperation between bidders for the same tender would hinder competition and cause a false perception that the procurement process was fair. “The behaviour of the companies would jeopardise the competitive process and cause losses to the government, and leakages in public funds,” he added. Iskandar said in addition to fines, the eight companies could be subjected to action under the Integrity in Public Procurement Circular (PK 1.6) read together with Non-compliance in Public Procurement Circular (PK 8) of the Finance Ministry effective June 1. Under that action, individuals or entities found involved in bid-rigging in public procurement could have their registration suspended for a maximum of five years, blacklisted and banned from joining or receiving procurement offers issued by government agencies for the duration of the suspension. “This decision shows MyCC’s commitment to continue tackling the issue of companies conspiring to manage public funds through bid-rigging,” he added. — Bernama "

This was after deputy public prosecutor Nahra Dollah informed the three-member panel of judges that the prosecution had accepted the trio’s oral representation to amend their charges. The panel comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Nordin Hassan subsequently convicted and sentenced Siow Kek Keong, Riduanshah Yahya and Mohd Saifulamry Jarkasi to seven years’ imprisonment. Siow, 52; Riduanshah, 40, an Indonesian; and Mohd Saifulamry, 35, a lorry driver; were initially charged under Section 3 (1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961. The charge was amended to abduction with the intention to wrongfully confine the boy under Section 365 of the Penal Code. The maximum sentence for kidnapping is death or life imprisonment and whipping, while the charge under Section 365 is punishable with imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine, on conviction. In November 2019, the Shah Alam High Court sentenced the three men to life imprisonment and two strokes of the rotan after they were found guilty of kidnapping the son of a contractor for a RM300,000 ransom at the roadside in Jalan Seroja, near Taman Setia, Sungai Chua, Kajang at 9.26am on October 9, 2015. Lawyers Datuk Geethan Ram Vincent, Belinda Low Siet Wan and S.S Seelan, representing Siow, Riduanshah and Mohd Saifulamry respectively, in mitigating for a reasonable jail sentence to begin from the date of arrest in October 2015, said their clients were remorseful and promised not to commit the offence again. Geethan Ram said the victim was unhurt and almost all the ransom money was recovered. Nahra said the three had served six years and nine months in jail and the jail term was adequate since the maximum jail sentence for the offence under Section 365 is seven years. She also asked the court to take into account that the offence committed by the three involved a five-year-old child. Geethan Ram told the media that his client would be released from prison today, taking into account one-third remission of the jail sentence. According to the facts of the prosecution’s case, the boy was abducted when his mother dropped him off at a kindergarten. The boy was returned to the family after the father paid the ransom money. — Bernama "

The court also needs to take into account the frequency of such cases where almost every day such cases are charged in court, besides the losses incurred by the complainant,” said the DPPs. — Bernama "

Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki, however, said it concerned only the alleged corruption involving the MRT and LRT projects carried out several years ago and not in any recent year. He said the French authorities had been investigating certain parties and companies in Malaysia and France to complete their report on Foreign Corrupt Practice by Public Official. “I cannot disclose any name of the parties or companies. We are in the midst of processing the (MLA) application and we have to bear in mind that any statement that we give to any other countries such as France, should be through the AGC. “We are still discussing with the AGC about how MACC can assist them as not all of their requests can be fulfilled. So, whatever we can assist, we will assist,” he told reporters after launching a Journalist Empowering Programme with the MACC, here, today. Azam said, in return, the French authorities were also required to assist the MACC upon application as the MACC had begun its investigation on the allegation earlier in March. “The scope of MACC investigation was relating to the bribe allegedly paid to certain parties…that is our focus and we have opened two investigation papers (relating to the MRT and LRT projects) so far,” he said. Last Monday, public transport operator Prasarana Malaysia said it viewed seriously the media reports citing sources claiming that there were elements of bribery in public transport infrastructure construction projects, namely involving the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) projects.

Judge Jamaludin Mat made the ruling after allowing the defence’s application to free Syed Shah Iqmal, 27, on both the charges. “The accused is acquitted and discharged in accordance with Section 254 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Code for both cases and bail (of RM25,000) is returned,” he said. On December 10, 2020, Syed Shah Iqmal pleaded not guilty to a charge of having unnatural intercourse with the woman, then aged 22, at his rented house at Damansara Perdana here, between 3am to 4am on October 17, 2020. He was charged under Section 377B of the Penal Code which provides imprisonment for up to 20 years as well as whipping, upon conviction. On the charge of using criminal force on the woman with intent to outrage her modesty at the same place and date, it was framed under Section 354 of the Penal Code, which provides an imprisonment for up to 10 years, or fine, or whipping, or any two of the punishments, if found guilty. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Norhashimah Hashim told the court that she had applied for Syed Shah Iqmal to be discharged not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) on both the charges. She said the application was made in accordance with Section 254 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. “After examining the case, the prosecution applied for a DNAA order, as among others, the complainant, in this case, suffered from serious depression to an extent of injuring herself several times and making death wishes,” she said, adding that the prosecution could still proceed with the case even if the complainant withdrew the police report. “The complainant or victim did not appear in court to take her oath to testify regarding the withdrawn police report. In this case, it is the prosecution that is applying for the DNAA after taking into account the complainant’s health condition,” she said. According to Norhashimah, the DNAA order will not prejudice the accused as long as he is not proven guilty and there was no need for him to feel burdened, being that he has been released on bail by the court previously. Lawyer Syed Amirul Syed Edros, representing Syed Shah Iqmal, applied for his client to be acquitted and discharged from the two charges as the defence believed the complainant did not intend to pursue the case and would only focus on the complainant’s oral evidence. “On grounds of the complainant suffering from depression and is in a bad state to testify is a shaky reason. It is apt to sympathise, but the court has fixed the dates 13 times, including for mention, but the complainant herself withdrew the report in December last year.” “This shows that the complainant is not interested in pursuing the case. The basic police report was withdrawn by the complainant voluntarily without coercion or the existence of an element of bribery,” said the lawyer. Syed Amirul said the investigation was conducted based on the complainant’s police report, which led to his client being charged in court on December 10, 2020. “This means that the case has been going on for 538 days since the accused was charged, but today the prosecution informed that it does not intend to continue the case. “In this regard, the defence is seeking a ‘decision’ from the court to prevent the case from continuing to be on hold and Syed Shah Iqmal can be charged at any time,” he said. — Bernama "

Earlier during mitigation, Devanandan asked the court to impose a lenient sentence on his client on grounds that Peter had cooperated until the end of the trial and appeared in court without fail when required. “In this case, Syarikat Asli Jati has helped hundreds of UMS students and he (Peter) had also helped the poor students at UMS,” said the lawyer. Deputy public prosecutor Haresh Prakash Somiah applied for a deterrent sentence as a lesson to others, including politicians and civil servants. He requested the court to impose a jail sentence of three to five years and a fine of between RM30,000 and RM50,000 on the accused. In this case, he said, UMS’s reputation as a public university, had also been affected as the contract given to REMT Utama Sdn Bhd had to be withdrawn. “The accused’s company seemed to have ‘hijacked’ the M&E work contract at UMS which was originally given to REMT Utama Sdn Bhd which had won the tender for the maintenance work through an open tender. “Imagine if REMT Utama were to sue UMS for the action.. the funds allocated for students had to be used to pay the suit,” he added. Haresh Prakash submitted that the accused had planned the scam to an extent that he wanted to meet with the then prime minister and finance minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak to get the project. According to the DPP, based on the testimony of the accused, it was confirmed that lobbying and seeking support through letters to obtain projects and tenders is a common practice in the country. “But it is appalling because it is by Peter who was the former Sabah Minister of Development and Infrastructure of Sabah,” he said. He said because of the action by the accused, two prosecution witnesses (SP) in the case, UMS deputy vice-chancellor (Academic & International) Professor Dr Shariff Abdul Kadir S. Omang (SP8) and former registrar Datuk Abdullah Mohd Said (SP9) had to bear the shame and suffering as disciplinary action was taken by UMS against them. “The accused was willing to do anything to get the project without taking into account the consequences and implications of his actions on other individuals,” he added. Meanwhile, Devanandan said his client would file an appeal against the jail sentence at the High Court soon. — Bernama "

According to Ramly, the police did not rule out the possibility that the remote location of the house had made their activities easier to conceal. Investigations are still underway to determine who the substance was sold to and how it is marketed. He said the former diplomat has been remanded for seven days from May 22, while a remand application against his son would be made today to assist in the investigations under Section 39 B of the Dangerous Drugs Act (ADB) 1952 and Section 6B of the ADB 1952. — Bernama "

The information will also be listed on the ‘Portal Semak Mule’ of the Commercial Crime Investigation Department (JSJK) which can be accessed through https://ccid.rmp.gov.my/semakmule. Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Mohd Kamarudin Md Din said the trend of commercial crime now is the increasing use of mule accounts by criminals to commit fraudulent activities online and through social media. “Last year, a total of 29,769 bank accounts were found to be used as mule accounts while for this year until May 10, a total of 1,669 mule accounts were recorded. “Of that number, a total of 12,659 individuals were arrested and charged in court for various offences for allowing their bank accounts to be used for criminal activities,” he said in a statement today. Mohd Kamarudin said police investigation showed that those who allow their accounts to be used by others were actually aware that they should not disclose any information on their bank account to any party as clearly stated in the terms and conditions when opening a bank account. He also warned any individual or company who no longer had control over their bank account to immediately close it to avoid arrest if the bank account is found to be used for illegal activities. Mohd Kamarudin also sought the cooperation of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the country to help police make the public aware that they can no longer hide as unknowing victims and stern action will be taken against the bank account holder as being a partner, accessory and accomplice to the crime. A mule account is when an individual or company allows their bank account to be controlled and used by criminals by handing over an automatic teller machine (ATM) card (PIN number) or providing an online banking password to criminals to receive money from fraudulent activities. — Bernama "

Justice Vazeer ordered Usuf to enter his defence before the same trial judge and fixed May 18 for case management. Meanwhile, the court also postponed Usuf’s appeal against his conviction and death sentence for the murder of another child, Rahimi Yusuf, at the same place, time and date.

Soh and Quah were convicted of a total of 180 and 169 charges respectively.

In particular, the statement said the trades between the controlled accounts were conducted to generate artificial liquidity and demand for these shares, to cause the share prices to rise over time, and to retain control of large amounts of shares without disclosing this to the market. The 58 account holders had handed over control of their accounts to Soh and Quah. “This is the largest market manipulation case in Singapore’s history,” said the statement.

He said the victim panicked and made money transfers five times into the same account from April 22 to April 26 amounting to RM132,900. He added that the suspect also asked the victim to wait for the results of the investigation and on April 30, she received a phone call and was asked to make an additional payment. “Realised that she had been cheated, the victim lodged a police report on the same day (April 30) and the suspect is now being tracked down.

In fact, cigarette smuggling activities have increased over the past two years despite the Covid-19 pandemic and regular enforcement operations mobilised by the authorities, according to 4th Battalion of the General Operations Force (GOF4) commanding officer Supt Rizal Mohamed. He said GOF4 managed to seize 7,982 cartons of cigarettes of various brands worth RM1,430,251 in 2020 and 115,526 cartons of contraband cigarettes worth RM25,985,425 last year. “A total of 9,415 cartons of cigarettes worth RM1,833,133 were seized and six individuals arrested from January to March this year,” he told Bernama. Rizal said the syndicates used different tactics and various modus operandi to prevent detection of their illicit activities. “The syndicates are not scared of the authorities due to the high demand and lucrative returns,” he said. Rizal said most cigarettes were smuggled in from Indonesia and Thailand and the syndicates managed to avoid detection as they were hiding behind the use of a legal route known as the ‘elephant trail’ in major ports. He said every day, there were tens of thousands of boxes of cigarettes entering Selangor through the port and it was quite difficult to detect the contraband items as they had been falsely declared as “permitted goods”. Therefore, Rizal said security controls at all entry points such as major ports needed to be tightened with the help of relevant agencies. He suggested that more scanners be installed at ports to detect prohibited items in containers, in addition to increasing the number of enforcement personnel to curb the smuggling activities. — Bernama "

He said KRT’s main functions include monitoring and investigating all issues on community conflicts in the area concerned and then reporting anything suspicious to the police. “Communities need to create awareness in neighbourhoods. They need to identify employment backgrounds (of those in the neighbourhood), who their neighbours are and so on so that when external elements enter the housing areas, they will be alerted. “Through the Voluntary Patrol Scheme available in KRTs, the community is able to monitor the neighbourhood and help prevent criminal activities,” he told Bernama recently. Saiman said his team is not able to conduct patrols in all housing areas, so KRTs serve as the “eyes” of the police. “They (KRTs) can make a citizen’s arrest if they see crimes being committed,” he said. Saiman also said the police especially JPJKK will play a consultative role in the community besides educating the community about the shared responsibility in crime prevention. “The police have a close relationship with KRTs. If there are KRTs which need police expertise, we will give guidance and briefings on how to identify suspects,” he added. — Bernama "

High Court Judge Datuk Ab Karim Ab Rahman fixed the date after hearing submissions from both parties at the end of the prosecution case. After thanking all parties for their submissions, during a four-day hearing which began on April 7, which lasted for four days, Judge Ab Karim said the court set May 30 at 2.30 pm to decide the matter.  The prosecution team comprised deputy public prosecutors Mohd Asnawi Abu Hanipah, Tengku Intan Suraya Tengku Ismail and Nur Sabrina Abu Bakar, while the defence team consisted of lawyers Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah and Rahmat Hazlan. Earlier, Tengku Intan Suraya, in her submission, argued  that the ‘Stage Crime Scene’ theory stated by the Forensic Pathology Officer at the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre,  Dr Prashant Sanberker, who is the 50th prosecution witness (SP50),  was justified as it was supported by explanations and findings during the visit at the scene.  “The testimony by SP50 on the theory is based on the discovery of two different patterns or post mortem hypostasis, at the back body of the deceased. This pattern takes  up to six hours to exist and from the next six to 12 hours to become fixed. “If the body is removed, the second shape will follow the first shape and if the deceased died on the floor, as found, there will only be one shape on the back of the deceased’s body,” she said, adding that apart from observing the pictures provided, SP50 also visited the scene on October 4, 2018. Meanwhile, Muhammad Shafee submitted that the prosecution consistently made a bare assertion that it was a ‘staged crime scene’,  but failed to define or elaborate what they meant by ‘staged’ and for what it encompassed.  “For example, is the prosecution claiming that the staging was for an ‘accident’ or ‘phone explosion’. With this ambiguity itself, the prosecution’s submission about ‘staged crime scene’ ought to be dismissed,” he said.  Muhammad Shafee said  Samirah was asked by police officer Sergeant Abdul Rahim Taha ( SP33), whether she heard an explosion, and she said ‘No’.  “If Samirah wanted to cover up a murder with an accident or ‘stage’ an accident, Samirah would have said ‘Yes’ that there was an explosion. In fact, on June 15, 2018, news about the fire and phone exploding was already out in public,” he said.  The prosecution closed its case last February 14 after calling 57 witnesses, including the deceased’s older siblings, brothers Dr Abdul Aziz and Dr Malek Reedzwan. and sister Che Elainee; Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department director Edwin Galan Anak Teruki; Pathology Forensic Officer from Kuala Lumpur Hospital Dr Siew Sheue Feng; Dr Prashant Sanberker and a security guard at the deceased’s residence, Raju Kumar Pandit. Hearing of the case began on September 6,  2019. On March 12, 2019, Samirah Muzaffar, 47, and the two teenagers, now aged 19 and 16, as well as an Indonesian woman, Eka Wahyu Lestari, who is still at large, are all charged with murdering Nazrin at his house in Mutiara Damansara, between 11.30 pm on June 13, 2018, and 4 am the following day. — Bernama "

PKPMP in a statement today said Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat has never communicated with or has been contacted by any political leaders on the court cases involving the former prime minister (Najib) and the Umno president (Ahmad Zahid). “In this regard, a police report has been made by this office to deny any allegations of conspiracy, collusion or illegal pact between political leaders and the Chief Justice. The office is referring to a posting on the Facebook page of Shahir Samad-Tok Uban dated April 20 which among others accused the Chief Justice of agreeing to expedite the cases and sentencing of Najib and Ahmad Zahid. According to the office, the cases which have not been settled need to proceed and continue according to the law without the interference of the Chief Justice or anybody. “This office stressed that the parties responsible for making and disseminating the allegations had aimed to tarnish the image and caused the public to lose confidence in the Judiciary. Apart from that, the allegations were aimed at subverting the administration of justice in term of the trial which has not been completed against Najib and Ahmad Zahid. On July 28, 2020, the High Court sentenced Najib to 12 years in prison and fined RM210 million after finding him guilty of misappropriating RM42 million of SRC International Sdn Bhd funds. The case is now at the appeal stage in the Federal Court after the Court of Appeal upheld the decision and sentence by the High Court and rejected the appeal by Najib. In the case of Ahmad Zahid, he had been ordered by the High Court to enter his defence on 47 charges involving criminal breach of trust, corruption and money laundering in relations to Yayasan Akalbudi (YAB) funds.

The three-panel judge led by Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said dismissed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Kuala Lumpur High Court’s decision, which had acquitted and released Syed Afendy Ali, 60, of the charges. Judge Kamaludin, in a unanimous decision, said the court found the appellant’s grounds put forward in the appeal could not convince the court to find the High Court judge had erred in giving a decision to set aside the Sessions Court’s judge’s findings. He added that the Court of Appeal would not interfere with the findings made by the High Court judge, who found that no prima facie case had been proved under Section 165 of the Penal Code against Syed Afendy Ali. “Therefore, the appeal by the prosecution is dismissed and the High Court’s decision was upheld,” said Kamaludin, who sat with Datuk Lee Heng Cheong and Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim. Upon hearing the verdict, Syed Afendy Ali fell on his knees and bowed in gratitude, before leaving the court. On November 27, 2020, High Court Judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah acquitted Syed Afendy Ali after allowing his appeal against the eight-month jail sentence and RM80,000 fine imposed by the Sessions Court on March 20, 2018. Judge Sequerah ruled that the prosecution had failed to prove the elements of Section 165 of the Penal Code that the appellant had obtained for the people mentioned in the charges a valuable thing which was the interest of immovable properties mentioned in all the charges. Based on the first to eight charges, Syed Afendy Ali, who was then DBKL’s Economic Planning and Development Department (JPEPP) director was charged with using his position to secure eight units of a condominium in Bandar Sri Permaisuri, Bandar Tun Razak here.

He added that an analysis by the police found that the only way for the syndicate to get money from the victim was through an advance payment that was supposed to be paid by the victim before the loan was approved. “Various tricks were used by the syndicate to obtain the advance payment, including legal fee, agreement fee, insurance fee, credit increase fee, CCRIS/CTOS fee, LHDN fee, account activation fee and so on,” he said. Mohd Kamarudin said this was unlike the money lending method practised by banking institutions or licensed money lending companies, in which any fees payable would be included as part of the loan amount. “Therefore, any loan scheme that asks for an advance payment is a scam and members of the public are advised to be careful and not fall for the tricks of the loan fraud syndicates,” he said.

This followed a decision by the Court of Appeal today in dismissing an appeal by Sulaiman Jalal, 49, to have his jail sentences for the two offences to run concurrently. Sulaiman was sentenced to three years in jail by the High Court on July 8, 2020, after he pleaded guilty to harbouring and concealing five Indonesian illegal immigrants. He did not appeal the decision. On August 17 last year, Sulaiman was sentenced to five years in jail by the High Court after he pleaded guilty to assisting “Geng Otong” to carry out human smuggling in Kota Tinggi, Johor, between Jan 1, 2015, and April 22, 2020. He was ordered by the High Court to begin the five years in jail term after completing the earlier three-year jail sentence, prompting him to appeal to the Court of Appeal for the jail sentences to be served concurrently. Today, the Court of Appeal’s three-man panel led by Justice Datuk Hanipah Farikullah dismissed Sulaiman’s appeal against the High Court’s order that he served the two jail terms consecutively. She said although Sulaiman was arrested on the same day, the two offences were distinct. Justice Hanipah who presided with Justices Datuk Gunalan Muniandy and Datuk Nordin Hassan said the High Court was right in his decision to order Sulaiman to serve the sentences consecutively. Sulaiman wanted his jail sentences for the two offences to be served concurrently, which means he would only serve five years imprisonment. According to the facts of the case, a police investigation revealed that Sulaiman had assisted the “Geng Otong” to smuggle Indonesian immigrants into Malaysia and also smuggled them back to Indonesia. Sulaiman was said to be the driver who would pick up the illegal immigrants who were smuggled by the criminal group to be sent to shelters. He also assisted the gang by playing the role of caretaker and supervisor of a transit point which served as a temporary collection point for newly entered undocumented immigrants. Sulaiman was arrested on April 23, 2020, for harbouring and concealing the Indonesian illegal immigrants in Kampung Bukit Raja Darat, Sungai Rengit, Kota Tinggi, Johor, by providing a shelter house for them to live temporarily or before they (illegal immigrants) return home to Indonesia by boat. In his statement recorded by the police, Sulaiman admitted that he was paid RM200 each time he transported the illegal immigrants.

Judge Datuk Abd Halim Aman handed down the sentence on Mohamad Shah Izwan Mohamad Zaki, 27, after amending the murder charge to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Judge Abd Halim in his summary judgment said based on the testimonies, there was no prior plan on the part of the accused to commit a fight, let alone a murder. “The cause of the fight that led to the death of the deceased started from the act of provocation that happened before that. The incident actually occurred due to the actions of the deceased himself who did not respect the local tradition and culture of the community here,” he said. Judge Abd Halim said the actions of the accused clearly showed that he had no ‘mens rea’ (intention) to kill the deceased. “Among them, the accused contacted the police to inform about the incident and he was also waiting at his mother’s house for the police to arrive,” he said. According to the charge, the accused was charged with murdering a Pakistani man, Muhammad Kashid, at his home on March 28, 2019, between 4 am and 5.15 am.

A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Has Zanah Mehat, Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Hashim Hamzah allowed the prosecution’s appeal to enhance Deputy Superintendent Mohd Ismail Syed Merah’s jail sentence. Previously, the High Court in Johor Bahru imposed a four-year jail sentence on Mohd Ismail, 59. It (the court) also allowed the prosecution’s appeal to impose a total fine of RM42 million on Mohd Ismail while failure to pay the fine would give him a jail term of 48 months. Meanwhile, the court dismissed Mohd Ismail’s appeal against his conviction and jail sentence. In the court’s unanimous decision, Justice Nordin said the court handed down the enhanced custodial sentence against Mohd Ismail to reflect the seriousness of his offence. He said the High Court judge was correct in his findings that the monies seized from Mohd Ismail’s house were proceeds from unlawful activities. He added that Mohd Ismail, as a police officer who was entrusted to uphold the law, had betrayed that trust and protected the illegal gambling operators. Justice Nordin said it was reasonable to infer that the RM1.27 million and 8,178,000 rupiah found in several boxes in Mohd Ismail’s house were monies, among others, from two operators of illegal gambling activities, for him (Mohd Ismail) not to take any action against these activities. “His salary as a police officer was only RM6,000 per month and paid into his bank account but how could he accumulate the large sum of money?” he said. Mohd Ismail was charged on the first five counts, with using monies obtained from unlawful activities, involving RM10,143.37, RM40,000, RM6,283.09, RM993,716.91 and RM500,000, respectively, to buy and increase investments in the Takaful Life Insurance Protection Plan and Takaful Link Plan registered under his daughter’s name, Nur Aqillah Mohd Ismail. The other two charges were for committing money laundering, involving RM499,620 and RM29,950, using a third party account belonging to one Tan Kim Tee. Mohd Ismail committed the offences at the MAA Takaful Building, Jalan Tun Razak, Johor Bahru and at two bank premises, namely, RHB and CIMB in Jalan Rahmat, Batu Pahat, Johor between September 4, 2014, and December 28, 2015. Mohd Ismail also faced the eighth charge of possessing RM1.27 million and 8,178,000 rupiahs in his house which were proceeds from unlawful activities. In 2019, Ismail was acquitted and discharged by the Johor Bahru Sessions Court of all the money laundering charges. However, in 2020, the High Court convicted him on all of the charges and sentenced him to four years’ jail on each charge and to run concurrently. On the first and second charges, the appellate court ordered Mohd Ismail to serve a year’s imprisonment on each of the charges that were to run concurrently. He was given one year and two years jail terms respectively on the third and fourth charge, and to also run concurrently. Ismail will start his two years jail sentence on his third and fourth charge after he completed his one-year imprisonment on the first and second charges. On the fifth charge, Mohd Ismail was sentenced to two years’ jail and another two years on the sixth charge. He was given a year’s imprisonment on the seventh charge and two years on the eighth charge. The jail terms are to run consecutively and to start after he (Mohd Ismail) completed the two years imprisonment on the third and fourth charges.

The charge was framed under Section 324 of the Penal Code which provides imprisonment for up to 10 years or with a fine or whipping or any two of the punishments if found guilty. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Mohd Isa Mohamed during submissions said that as a Malaysian citizen, the accused should have been more sensitive to the current Covid-19 situation in the country by not smoking and removing his face masks when he was in public spaces. “According to the facts of the case, the accused had waited for the victim outside the supermarket after being reprimanded and this showed that it was a premeditated crime. “The accused then took a machete from his car and this shows that he did not act in self-defence. An attack using a machete can cause death to the victim,” he said. Lawyer T.P Aravind Raj, representing Samasiveng, requested leniency saying that his client had to take care of his wife and grandchildren. — Bernama "

A three-judge panel comprising justices Datuk Nor Bee Ariffin, Datuk Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali made the unanimous decision after allowing the appeal of N. Sanderasegaran, 34, as the appellant. Judge Nor Bee set aside the conviction under Section 302 of the Penal Code and replaced it with a conviction and sentence under Section 304 (a) of the same code, after being satisfied that the appeal had merit. On October 2, 2018, Sanderasegaran was sentenced to death by the Ipoh High Court for killing his girlfriend, S. Durga Devi, 17, at a house in Kampung Batu Besi, Ladang Sengat, Simpang Pulai between 11pm on February 27, 2016, and 6am the next day. Earlier, lawyer Afifuddin Ahmad Hafifi, who represented Sanderasegaran, applied for the conviction and sentence against his client under Section 302 to be set aside and replaced with Section 304 (a). Afifuddin argued that there was a flaw in the narrative presented by the sixth prosecution witness (SP6), who was the appellant’s neighbour, that he did not witness the incident that night, while the voices he heard were mere assumptions. The lawyer said there was a serious miscarriage of justice against his client when the prosecution did not offer a witness named Peruwati Samiran (SP6’s wife) who was said to have witnessed the incident. Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohd Fairuz Johari, on the other hand, argued that the conviction and sentence were safe to uphold because the trial judge had made the findings of the case based on the testimony of witnesses during the trial. “The version that a robbery had taken place was investigated and found to be baseless, while there were no footprints of individuals in the house to prove the existence of other parties at the scene. The trial judge was also satisfied that SP6 was a credible witness, and had no intention of persecuting the appellant,” he said. — Bernama "

A three-judge panel led by Justice Datuk Hanipah Farikullah made that decision after counsel Alex De Silva, representing the appellant, Yusof Holmes Abdullah, 78, informed the court that the Attorney-General’s (AG) Chambers had allowed the application to set aside the jail sentence. De Silva said this was because a representation to set aside the sentence had been made to the AG’s Chambers in February. “The appellant withdrew his appeal against the conviction while the respondent (public prosecutor) withdrew the appeal against the sentence as the AG’s Chambers had allowed my client’s representation to set aside the jail sentence of one month while the fine of RM50,000 remained,” he said and added that the appellant had paid the fine. Deputy public prosecutor Samihah Rhazali confirmed the matter. Justice Hanipah, who sat with Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Ghazali Cha, said that after hearing the submissions from counsel and the DPP and following the decision of the AG’s Chambers, the court decided that the conviction against the appellant and RM50,000 fine imposed by the High Court remained and the jail sentence set aside. “The appellant’s appeal against conviction and the respondent’s cross-appeal against the sentence is thus withdrawn,” said Justice Hanipah. On January 5, 2017, the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court sentenced Yusof Holmes, a British national with permanent resident status in Malaysia, to six months’ jail and fined him RM20,000 for committing the offence but allowed a stay of the jail sentence and fine until the decision on the appeal case is made by the High Court. The Kuala Lumpur High Court in its decision on July 18, 2019, ordered the jail sentence be reduced to one month and the fine be increased to RM50,000.

He said the imposition of excise duties had had an impact on cigarette smuggling but it remains to be seen whether the effect could be sustained. “We will continue to monitor (excise duty policy) whether it works well or not,” he told reporters after making an official visit to Labuan Liberty Wharf (Labuan containerised port) here today. Abdul Latif said industry players could give their views and suggestions to the Customs on the impact of the government’s decision to impose excise duties on cigarettes and tobacco products. “According to a study commissioned by British American Tobacco (BAT), cigarette smuggling has caused the government to incur losses of up to RM5.1 billion in cigarette taxes annually. This figure is a challenge to us to curb this illicit activity,” he said. Abdul Latif said the customs department recorded a 9.9 per cent increase in tax collection to RM42.5 billion last year from RM38.67 billion in 2020. “We are optimistic of collecting a RM45 billion revenue for the government’s coffers this year, but it will depend on the economic situation. With all the economic sectors now allowed to operate, we are very sure we can achieve the target,” he said. Earlier, he was briefed by Labuan port operator Megah Port Management Sdn Bhd on the improvement to port facilities, including the completion of concrete container yard and port security fencing projects. He said the Labuan port should continue to expand its operations and services to cater for the oil and gas-related sectors in this island. “Customs will facilitate whatever business transactions the port operator is dealing with, and the port operator must constantly consult our officers on any new policies enforced,” he said. — Bernama "

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) assistant director (telecommunications criminal investigation) Supt Rozeni Ismail said during that period more than 30,000 individuals were detained and from the number, 25,000 individuals were charged in court. “Most of them were mule account holders while those who were not charged in court were placed under the Crime Prevention Act 1959 which included restricted residence for a certain period of time,” he said during a town hall discussion on the threats posed by scammers in society here today. He said most of the cases involved Macau Scam, online sales and purchases, non-existent money loans and love scams. Commenting further, Rozeni said that one of the reasons scammers managed to deceive their victims was that they operated using telephones or social media other than recruiting victims to become mule account holders. “This is what makes the syndicates successful when recruiting people, regardless of giving, renting or allowing them to use their (bank) accounts for financial transactions from these online criminal activities. “If we can successfully deal with the mule account holders, we believe that the police will be able to cripple the criminal activities of the scammers,” he said. Meanwhile, Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Datuk Azmi Abu Kassim said online fraud cases such as the Macau Scam, Love Scam and e-purchase in the capital had gone up even though the country was still coping with the Covid-19 pandemic. He said a total of 4,340 cases with losses of RM665 million were recorded last year compared to 4,062 cases with a loss of RM637 million recorded in 2020. “This shows that there are still a handful of people who are easily deceived by offers, easily persuaded and are less aware of cybercrimes, thus causing them to lose millions of dollars. “Some of the victims claimed that they had never heard of such online scams and had never been given information related to this issue,” he said.

It was the unanimous decision of a three-man panel of judges, headed by Judge Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, who restored the six-month jail sentence and RM2,000 fine imposed on Muhammad Adib Abd Halim, 28, by the Kajang Magistrate’s Court on November 16, 2018. The judge set aside the Shah Alam High Court’s decision on June 26, 2019, which revised Muhammad Adib’s six-month jail term to a one-day jail and increased the fine from RM2,000 to RM4,000. In her judgement, Judge Hanipah said that according to Section 323 of the Penal Code, the maximum fine that can be imposed is RM2,000 and the punishment meted out to Muhammad Adib as the respondent is illegal. “With this, the whole sentence (one-day jail and RM4,000 fine) imposed by the Shah Alam High Court is not valid because it is not in accordance with Section 323 of the Penal Code and it should be set aside by this court,” said Judge Hanipah, who sat with judges Datuk P. Ravinthran and Datuk Hashim Hamzah. According to Judge Hanipah, in this case, the public prosecutor had appealed against the entire sentence by a High Court judge and the court found that under Section 323 of the Penal Code, the sentence provided could not exceed a one-year jail term or a fine not exceeding RM2,000 or both. “According to the appeal record, it is clear that the Magistrate’s Court imposed the sentence in accordance with the provisions of the law. Factors taken into consideration by the magistrate in deciding on the respondent’s sentencing among others considered the injuries suffered by the victim resulting in a two-day hospitalisation. “We found the Magistrate’s Court also considered that the victim was under the respondent’s custody apart from taking into account the mitigation factors put forward by the respondent in sentencing,” she said. She said the court found that the High Court judge had interfered with the sentence passed by the magistrate and did not touch at all on what mistakes were made by the magistrate and the principle of punishment applied. “Therefore, this court should intervene in the decision of the High Court judge. With this, the sentence imposed by the High Court is set aside and the sentence by the Magistrate Court is reinstated. “The fine if overpaid by the respondent must be returned to him. The six-month jail sentence is effective immediately and a committal warrant is issued,” she said. Muhammad Adib was previously tried on charges of causing injury to an 11-year-old boy in a classroom at a religious primary school in Bandar Seri Putra, Hulu Langat, at 2.25pm, on August 16, 2017, and charged under Section 323 of the Penal Code.

He said if the transaction of an account raised suspicion, the bank could impose temporary restrictions to enable a comprehensive assessment to be carried out while ensuring that money from fraudulent or other criminal activities is not withdrawn from the account. “This is implemented based on the analysis conducted by the bank. “Among the forms of restrictions that can be imposed by banks are restricting Internet banking facilities, debit cards and automatic teller machines, besides closing the accounts after banks are satisfied with their assessment results,” he said during the question and answer session with the minister at Parliament today. He said this in response to a question from Baling MP Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim who asked whether the bank has the authority to close customers’ accounts based on the fact that there are suspicious transactions in the accounts. Tengku Zafrul said the bank could decide to continue the transaction or business dealings with the account holder or discontinue the transaction and close the customer’s account after assessing the appropriate level of risk, subject to a restraining order issued by the authorities. “Account closure measures are only taken after a thorough assessment has been carried out, and after giving notice within a reasonable period to the customer. “In a nutshell, the termination of the relationship between the bank and customer is not a requirement under the law. It is a business call by the bankers or financial institutions based on their internal risk assessment,” he added. — Bernama "

He said the huge losses were detected from 7,209 cases involving the syndicate throughout the country. Selangor had the highest number of cases, with 2,311, followed Perak (1,349); Kuala Lumpur (732); Johor (723); Negeri Sembilan (599); Kedah (481); Pulau Pinang (344); Melaka (314); Pahang (288); Kelantan (37); Perlis (19); and Terengganu (12), he added. According to him, MACC detained 18 local men, including the syndicate’s mastermind, aged between their 30s and 60s, in a nationwide operation yesterday. “One of the suspects controlled 500 premises in Peninsular Malaysia. We also seized RM2.3 million in cash involving 998 premises,” he said at a special media conference at the MACC headquarters here today. Azam said MACC also seized RM281,180 in cash, froze 126 bank accounts holding a total of RM4.4 million belonging to 97 individuals and 29 companies and confiscated 1,157 mining rigs, each worth an estimated RM2,000 totalling RM2.3 million, as well as RM82,000 in e-wallet credit. Various cryptocurrencies worth RM108,545.38 (US$25,893.46), five cars — a BMW, a Honda Accord, a Toyota Vellfire, a Ford Ranger and an Audi — as well as various jewellery were also seized.  “Intelligence gathered by the MACC confirmed these incidents occurred almost all over the country and we detected a total of 998 premises rented for such activities,” he explained. He said the syndicate operators would negotiate with TNB officers during enforcement operations while Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) confirmed there were bribes between RM3,000 and RM300,000 offered to ensure enforcement action would not be taken and to gain leaked information about operations. Azam said bribes were paid on a monthly basis in two ways, cash and cryptocurrency.

MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said the Commission would continue its efforts to recover and help return the related monies lost through 1MDB to the country. “Right now, I cannot share any other names involved. What is next is to get the cooperation from the Attorney-General’s Chambers for us to get any related statements from the parties in the US,” he told a press conference at the MACC headquarters here today.

Selangor police chief Datuk Arjunaidi Mohamed in a statement today said studies found that apart from the level of awareness and the victim’s attitude, the rise in cases is also from the ease scammers are able to open individual’s accounts as mule accounts. “It is easy to register an individual’s name to become a mule organisation with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) and later open a bank account in the name of the company /business of the mule. “The mule accounts are later used to transfer hundreds and even millions of ringgit from the accounts of victims. Apart from that, there are cybercriminals who succeeded in hacking the e-mail and Internet banking accounts of victims and withdrew money from the accounts of victims without their knowledge,” he said. Therefore, Arjunaidi said if there are applications to change the ID of users via e-mail or any other suspicious changes in the internet banking transactions, the banks should check with the account or company owner for confirmation. “Banks need to create a more secure check and balance system for all Internet banking transactions via internet or e-banking to prevent mule accounts from being widely used by criminals to transfer proceeds of their criminal activities,” he said. He also said in the first two months of this year, 405 investigations papers have been opened on cyber fraud and crimes involving RM33.7 million in losses in Selangor alone. — Bernama "

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (CID) chief, Datuk Seri Abd Jalil Hassan said these numbers were considered very high compared to the previous year’s statistics, with only 20 investigation papers opened and 26 people arrested, and the total seizures valued at RM1.26 million. “The majority of those arrested were aged 18 to 30 years, believed to be easily influenced simply because of the promise of lucrative income while the oldest suspect was aged 61. “We also opened 20 files under the Prevention of Crime Act (Poca) last year and from this number, 10 individuals so far have been placed under restriction order,” he said at a press conference after witnessing the disposal of items used in electricity theft for bitcoin mining activities by the Pahang contingent police, here, today. Also present were Pahang police chief, Datuk Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf; its CID chief, SAC Mohd Yusri Othman, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) chief distribution network officer, Wan Nazmy Wan Mahmood and Rompin magistrate, Wahidah Zainal Abidin. Statistically, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Perak and Penang registered the highest number of illegal bitcoin mining cases as the offenders would take advantage of a large number of industrial areas in these states for the activity since it uses a lot of electricity. “Most of the suspects used business premises that are isolated or hidden from the public as the activity will emit noise and heat apart from frequently causing power outage due to the high usage of electricity,” said Abd Jalil. He said police would discuss with the Attorney-General’s Chambers to charge the offenders under Section 379 and Section 427 of the Penal Code which provides for imprisonment compared to Section 37 of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 which carries a fine or imprisonment, if convicted. Meanwhile, Wan Nazmy said a total of 7,209 cases of electricity theft involving bitcoin mining premises were recorded over a period of three years from 2018. “This activity has also resulted in fire outbreaks due to non-compliance with specifications of the Energy Commission and TNB. “TNB now uses drones which can detect heat from the air at premises suspected of committing electrical theft for illegal bitcoin mining apart from monitoring areas recording high electricity usage but with low meter readings,” he said. Wan Azmy added that TNB’s Special Engagement Against Losses (SEAL) team, formed 10 years ago, had been strengthened in the last three years to combat electricity theft for illegal bitcoin mining. — Bernama "

They were charged under Section 5 (1) of the Computer Crimes 1997 and punishable under Section 5(4) of the same Act which provides a maximum fine of RM150,000 or a maximum jail sentence of 10 years or both if the act is done with intention of causing injury as defined in the Penal Code. In 2014, the High Court upheld the decision of the Sessions Court, prompting Muralitharan and Pathmanathan to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In today’s proceedings before the Court of Appeal, Pathmanathan’s lawyer, Datuk Geethan Ram Vincent, told the court that the representation by his client and Muralitharan had been accepted, whereby the prosecution agreed to impose a fine on the two men provided that they withdraw the appeal on their conviction. Both Geethan Ram and Muralitharan’s counsel, Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, requested the court to impose a fine of RM30,000. Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Khushairy Ibrahim requested the court to impose fine of RM70,000 on each count, saying due to their act, a total of 681 servers were affected and required restoration work to be carried out in countries including Malaysia, United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia and Kazakhstan. — Bernama "

A Court of Appeal three-member bench led by Justice Datuk Hanipah Farikullah held that the High Court had erred in acquitting and discharging Goh Hwa Kiang, 41. Justice Hanipah who presided with Justices Datuk Lee Heng Cheong and Datuk Nordin Hassan allowed the prosecution’s appeal to reinstate the Sessions Court decision. She said a Supreme Court decision in ‘Public Prosecutor vs Zainuddin Sulaiman and ors’ held that the court has no power to acquit an accused without hearing all evidence from the prosecution. Following this decision, Goh can be re-charged for the offences. Goh, 41, was charged on September 29, 2018, with the possession of a Smith and Wesson pistol under Section 8 of the Firearms Act (Increased Penalty) 1971 as well as for allegedly attempting to murder K. Kalidass. According to the charge sheet, he allegedly committed the offences in front of a house at Batu 3/4, Jalan Pantai Tanjung, Piandang, Kerian district, Perak at 2.15 am on July 19, 2018. On July 13, 2020, the Sessions Court gave Goh a DNAA after the prosecution produced four witnesses including the arresting officer and investigating officer. This means Goh can be re-charge for the offences. Goh filed a revision application to the High Court which, on February 24, 2021, acquitted and discharged him, meaning Goh cannot be prosecuted for the same offence. Deputy public prosecutor Zaki Asyraf Zubir submitted that the prosecution did not apply for DNAA against Goh before the Sessions Court. He said instead, the prosecution only requested for postponement of the trial because the witnesses could not be subpoenaed due to a change of the investigating officer, adding that the investigating officer who took over from the previous investigating officer overlooked the matter. Zaki Asyraf said that was the first and only time that the prosecution witnesses did not turn up in court. Goh’s lawyer Datuk Naran Singh submitted that the High Court had acquitted and discharged Goh of the charges because the key prosecution witnesses had testified. — Bernama "

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Datuk Kamarudin Md Din said they received two reports by the two businessmen in January, and were investigating the crimes under Section 420 of the Penal Code for fraud. The victims had entered into discussions with parties claiming that they could help in procuring self-test kits from a manufacturer in China. One of them even made payments of RM600,000 for 100,000 self-testing kits, including delivery costs. “After the payments were made, the kits were never delivered. The victims then inquired with the manufacturer but were told that no such orders were ever placed,” he said at a special media conference here today. Mohd Kamarudin also advised the public, especially traders, to be always vigilant and conduct due diligence before making payments, especially when it involves big amounts to avoid being cheated. In a separate development, he said police had also detected bank account hacking activities through the download of Android Package Kit (APK) files with five reports lodged so far, three in Johor and one each in Penang and Sabah, with losses of RM58,844. Investigations revealed that syndicates would advertise products or TV channel services on Facebook, and interested buyers were asked to contact them via WhatsApp. They were then instructed to download and install an app via an APK file link, which would actually replace the existing SMS (short message service) system without their knowledge. Victims were also instructed to register by providing information including their names, identity card numbers, as well as details of their email, credit card and online banking services, before being given access to use the app, he added. “After they have provided the information, an error message will appear as the application is not linked to legitimate banking sites. The syndicate’s main purpose is to gain access to the contents of the victim’s SMS texts, as well as banking details, which will be used to transfer money from the victim’s account,” he explained. The police, he said, were investigating the five cases under Section 420 of the Penal Code for fraud and believed that the mastermind was still in the country. He also reminded the public to not be deceived by ads on social media and not to simply download any APK files.

In a statement of defence filed by his lawyers at the Kuala Lumpur High Court on January 26 in relation to a civil suit by 1MDB, Jho Low, 41, claimed that the lawsuit should be dismissed as it failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action over allegations of breach of trust or fiduciary duty. On May 7 last year, 1MDB and its four subsidiaries namely 1MDB Energy Holdings Limited, 1MDB Energy Limited, 1MDB Energy (Langat) Limited and Global Diversified Investment Company Limited, formerly known as 1MDB Global Investments Limited, filed a US$3.7837 billion suit against Jho Low, his parents Tan Sri Larry Low Hock Peng and Puan Sri Goh Gaik Ewe, his sister May Lin, his younger brother Taek Szen and his associate Eric Tan Kim Loong as the defendants. Jho Low said that he has never been a director or shareholder in 1MDB or its four subsidiaries, nor was he a member of the sovereign wealth fund’s board of advisors or a part of the management team of any of the five plaintiffs. As such, Jho Low said he has no legal standing to exercise control over the plaintiffs, including but not limited to directing or otherwise causing the alleged transfer and/or receipt of funds. Jho Low said 1MDB’s lawsuit against him is redundant as the United States (US) Department of Justice (DoJ) had already achieved a “global, comprehensive resolution” with him over the DoJ’s 1MDB-linked civil action against him, without any finding of “guilt, fault, liability or any form of wrongdoing”. He claimed that 1MDB’s present civil action against him was based on the DoJ filings regarding certain allegations, and claimed that the sovereign wealth fund at the same time ignored the resolution of the DoJ civil action against him. Jho Low contended that the resolution of the DoJ civil action led to the voluntary forfeiture and repatriation of assets for the ultimate benefit of the Malaysian government, which ultimately is also to the benefit of the plaintiffs. “The plaintiffs in the suit herein are ultimately owned by the government of Malaysia through Minister of Finance (Incorporated), and in effect, the government of Malaysia is the prime mover of the present suit against the defendants named herein. “As such, the plaintiffs’ claims are redundant. In further consideration of the foregoing, the plaintiffs’ claims amount to an impermissible double counting of such repatriated assets, and therefore should not be considered as forfeitable sums,” Jho Low claimed. Based on the statement of claim, all the plaintiffs claimed that they were manipulated by a group of individuals, including Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and the first defendant (Jho Low) to facilitate a large-scale and long-term fraud which resulted in billions of ringgit being fraudulently misappropriated into privately controlled accounts for the benefit of various fraudsters, including the defendants.

In 2019, the Sessions Court found Mohd Juhazei guilty of both charges and sentenced him to 15 years’ jail and five strokes of the rotan for committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature and seven years and two strokes of the rotan for outraging the woman’s modesty. The High Court in 2020 dismissed Mohd Juhazei’s appeal against his conviction but allowed his appeal to reduce the jail sentence. Mohd Juhazei’s jail term for the carnal intercourse offence was reduced to 10 years while that for the molestation offence was reduced to five years. The High Court maintained the seven strokes of whipping. Mohd Juhazei was ordered to serve the jail sentences concurrently which means he would only serve 10 years.

On the success of the Sentul police in their battle against cyber crimes, he said the latest was they busted an online gambling syndicate on Jan 13 after raiding a condominium unit, here, that was used as a call centre. Beh said following the raid, three men believed to be involved in the online gambling activities were detained and further investigations found that the syndicate was able to rake in profit of up to RM100,000 a month. According to him, the modus operandi of such syndicates was to promote easy ways to earn money by sharing links on social media sites such as Facebook and WeChat to deceive their victims. He said there were also syndicates offering job seekers a commission as an online purchasing agent. Beh said the syndicates would usually pay the promised commissions for the first two purchases made by the victims. However, he said the syndicates would delay payments after the victims made their subsequent purchase before being uncontactable. Beh also advised the public to be wary of syndicates impersonating official authorities such as police through telephone calls. “If members of the public receive calls from suspicious numbers, stop the conversation immediately and hang up. Inform your family members or friends and check the number by contacting the nearest police station,” he said.

Instead, Judge Datuk Abd Halim Aman ordered the teenager Daniel Iskandar, 19, to perform community service for 120 hours, which must be completed within six months at local mosques. The judge also suggested that the mosque committee, those who recorded and caused the video of the teenager to go viral, openly apologise to the teenager and the general public to clear the air. Abd Halim also reprimanded and reminded the public not to take the law into their own hands, but instead should learn the lesson from the teenager’s case for the sake of the Malaysian Family. “The court is aware that the teenager had already served the 10 days’ jail and also paid the RM4,000 fine, but for the sake of his future and to have a clean record, the decision must be delivered,” he said when reading the judicial review of the sentence meted out by the Magistrate’s Court’s on Daniel on Jan 13. Following that, the judge said Daniel must also report to the Social Welfare Department (JKM) officer within seven days from today and was also required to follow the schedule set for him. “The young offender is required to follow the activities and programmes as well as adhere to other instructions from the JKM and the community service must specifically be carried out at mosques only,” he said. He said the order was made under Section 293 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) and if the teenager failed to comply with the order, he could be brought back to court and punished with the original punishment. On the punishment meted out by the Magistrate’s Court, Abdul Halim said the court found that there was a misconception of law, misdirection and miscarriage of justice against the accused. “At the same time, the court found that the punishment does not show a form of rehabilitation with the facts clearly showing that the accused is the first offender and has pleaded guilty. What he did was just an attempt to steal and no loss was suffered by the mosque,” he said. Daniel was represented by lawyers Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali, Fahmi Abdul Moin, Azman Abdullah dan Ilyani Khuszairy. Deputy public prosecutor Norhana Sahat appeared for the prosecution, while two lawyers held a watching brief namely Muhammad Hariz Md Yusoff from the Muslim Lawyers Association of Malaysia (PPMM) and Megat Abdul Munir Megat Abdullah Rafaie representing the Al Islahiah Mosque.

Magistrate Nik Mohd Fadli Nik Azlan meted out the sentence against Daniel Iskandar, 19, after he pleaded guilty to attempting to steal the box from the Al Islahiah Mosque by dragging and hiding it in the body bathing room at the mosque in Kuang, Rawang here, at 11.58 pm on January 8. The charge was framed in accordance with Section 380 of the Penal Code read together with Section 511 of the code which provides for a maximum jail term of 10 years and a possible fine. “I plead guilty,” said the young man who was clad in a blue T-shirt when asked by the court interpreter to make his plea. Prior to sentencing, Nik Mohd Fadli reprimanded the accused over his actions. “Do you know what you have done wrong? The money which had been contributed for the community and the development of the mosque, you stole and kept it the mortuary. I hope this serves as a lesson and a wake-up call for you,” said Nik Mohd Fadli. The court also ordered the unemployed accused to serve his jail term from the date of arrest on January 9, adding that he would be jailed for another five months if he failed to pay the fine. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Wan Nur Iman Wan Ahmad Afzal requested the court to mete out a deterrent punishment against the accused and to prevent others from committing a similar act. Lawyer Azman Abdullah, who represented Daniel, requested leniency on the grounds that this was his client’s first offense and he had repented. “My client has apologised to the court and the mosque. The reason he did it (tried to steal) was because he needed money to buy medicine for his grandfather who is diabetic. He tried to ask people, but they couldn’t help him. “My client is the eldest of three siblings and his parents have been divorced since he was eight years old. He lives with his grandfather who is in his 70s, and life is not easy for them. Even their food and drink comes from the donation of their neighbours, “said Azman who is a pro bono lawyer. Azman said although it was wrong for the accused to steal, the action of the parties who took the video and spread it on social media was not appropriate, as it had put unnecessary pressure on the accused and his family. Based on the facts of the case, on the day of the incident, the complainant who was a caretaker at the mosque found the mosque’s donation box was missing. Based on closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, it was found that a man had damaged the donation box before dragging and hiding it in the body bathing room. The complainant and members of the mosque committee suspected that the man lived near the mosque, and when they patrolled the area, they came across the individual seen in the CCTV footage before approaching him and asking if he had broken into the mosque and stolen the donation box. The young man later admitted that he committed the act, after which the mosque committee members apprehended him and contacted the police. The media previously reported about a one-minute-25 second viral video that showed members of the mosque bathing a man like a ‘corpse’ for stealing the donation box. — Bernama "

He said this when speaking to reporters after conducting a working visit to the CID’s D3 Division of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants (Atipsom) and the Anti-Vice, Gambling and Secret Societies Division (D7) at Menara KPJ here yesterday. Police had earlier made several series of arrests linked to the vaccine syndicate here and the cases are being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. “As such, I appeal to the public not to be easily duped by promotions of vaccine sale on social media,” he said. Abd Jalil said certain parties were taking advantage of the situation to make fast bucks as they knew some people were stressed by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. — Bernama "

Selangor Police chief Datuk Arjunaidi Mohamed said police seized 934.41 kilogrammes (kg) of heroin, 70 kg of syabu and 56.24 kg of heroin base, and arrested eight locals belonging to both syndicates, aged between 24 and 45, in the raids. He said the Bukit Aman Narcotics Crime Investigation Department conducted six raids on the first syndicate at different locations around Bandar Kinrara, Puchong; Subang Jaya and Brickfields on Monday. He explained that police arrested a man and seized an estimated 10.3 kg of syabu and 6.3kg of heroin from his car in a condominium in Bandar Kinrara. “Upon searching the suspect’s home, police also seized 27 packets of syabu (estimated at 29.2 kg) and 129 plastic bags containing an estimated 84.51 kg of heroin. “In the second raid on a terrace house in Bandar Kinrara, 524 pills believed to be ecstasy, 1.45 grams of suspected cannabis and 2.32 grams of syabu were also seized along with RM1.08 million in cash, believed to be proceeds from the sale and trafficking of drugs. Another suspect was also arrested,” he said in an online media conference today. Arjunaidi said following the two arrests, four other suspects were then nabbed around Subang Jaya and Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur on the same day, adding that the total drugs seized were worth RM3.24 million. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, police moved in on the second syndicate and arrested two local men, aged 25 and 41, at Seri Kembangan and seized syabu and heroin base worth RM11.09 million.

Arjunaidi said the suspects for both cases had been remanded for two to seven days from Tuesday and the cases would be investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. Meanwhile, in BUKIT MERTAJAM, police arrested a 21-year-old man and seized syabu and heroin worth RM3.5 million along with a pistol and ammunition in two raids in Kepala Batas and Bukit Minyak on May 19. Penang Police chief Datuk Sahabudin Abd Manan said the arrest of the man, who they believe is the mastermind of the syndicate, led to a raid on a shophouse in Bukit Minyak that the syndicate used to stash its drugs. “Police seized syabu (97.14 kg), heroin (190 g), chemicals (acetic acid, denatured alcohol and hydrocloric acid) as well as equipment and a packaging machine during the raid. We also found a pistol with two magazines filled with 15 bullets,” he said in a statement today. He said investigations revealed that the syndicate had been active since January and the drugs were worth RM3.5 million, adding that the man had been remanded for seven days to facilitate investigations under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and Section 8 of the Firearms Act 1971. In a separate development, he said police crippled another drug trafficking syndicate following the arrest of three men, aged 24 to 26, and the seizure of RM310,000 worth of drugs in two raids in Mak Mandin and Butterworth on May 19. “Police first arrested a mechanic at 7 pm by the side of a road in Mak Mandin and, upon searching the two cars in the suspect’s possession, they found heroin (15.902 kg) and syabu (3.622 kg) with a total estimated value of RM310,000,” he said. He said police then arrested two other men in Butterworth believed to be syndicate members and investigations revealed that all three had been involved in drug trafficking activities since early this year.

The three suspects have been remanded for six days and will be investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, he added. — Bernama "

Judge Datuk Noorin Badaruddin handed down the sentence on Aaron Teoh Eng Wan, 37, and his wife, En Sit Mooi, 40, after finding that the prosecution had succeeded in proving the case beyond a reasonable doubt. “There was overwhelming evidence that the couple had committed murder and the prosecution has brought forward a case that is beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Noorin. The couple looked stunned upon hearing the sentence before they broke down into tears in the dock. Aaron and En were charged with murdering Adrian Teoh Wai Kit, the eldest of their two children, at premises in Regalia Business Centre, Subang Jaya between 2pm and 3.30pm on May 26, 2017. The charge was framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code read together with Section 34 of the same code, which provides for the mandatory death penalty if found guilty. Aaron and En were also sentenced to eight years in jail from the date they were arrested on May 26, 2017, for another charge of abuse resulting in injuries to the victim at the same location, time and date. For this offence, they were charged under Section 31 (1) (a) of the Child Act 2001 read together with Section 31 (5) of the same act which is punishable under Section 31 (1) of the same act. Earlier, lawyers Tan Teck Yew and Tina Ong who represented both the accused told the court that the victim’s grandmother and aunt should be called to testify as the victim had been under their care, to see whether the boy’s injuries may have been caused by someone other than his parents. However, Noorin said the results from the pathology laboratory confirmed that old injuries, where there were traces of rib fractures, and new injuries which caused the victim’s death, were already sufficient. The prosecution presented 28 witnesses to the stand while the defence team presented two witnesses, namely the husband and wife who chose to testify under oath on the witness stand, throughout the trial which started in July 2019. In her opening remarks during the trial, deputy public prosecutor Siti Fatimah Yahya told the court that the victim was beaten by his parents using a cane and a stick. The pathologist’s testimony revealed that the cause of the boy’s death was due to extensive subcutaneous and muscle haemorrhage, due to multiple blunt force trauma. The testimony of other prosecution witnesses such as the chemist also confirmed that there was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) belonging to Aaron and the victim on a cane found at the scene and the CCTV recording at the premises showed En dragging the victim, who was weak and feeble, several times. The couple were first charged at the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court on June 5, 2017. — Bernama "

https://selangorjournal.my/2021/04/majority-of-terrorists-supporters-will-be-rehabilitated-bukit-aman/,Majority of terrorists’ supporters will be rehabilitated — Bukit Aman,2021-04-18T09:40:29+08:00,"KUALA LUMPUR, April 18 — A majority of terrorist groups’ supporters who were found guilty were not only sentenced to prison but would also undergo rehabilitation, said Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Division (E8) principal assistant director DCP Normah Ishak. She said that the process, among others, through the application of special modules, was to correct the understanding and views of these supporters, on issues that they believed in as well as disputed. “The special modules are among those arranged by the Prisons Department and the Special Branch for all prisoners involved in terrorist groups, charged under Chapter VI A of the Penal Code, which involves criminal offences relating to terrorism. “Through that (special modules) the punishment imposed is generally not focused on imprisonment, for them to serve the sentence. In fact, their welfare and well-being are actually taken care of and they are sentenced to be rehabilitated,” she told Bernama recently. She said that, for that purpose, experts in the field of religion would be provided to communicate with the prisoners to answer questions and give a correct understanding of Islam, jihad, end of time, Imam Mahdi and whatever issues they have in their minds. “This kind of exposure or approach gives space and opportunity to highlight issues that they feel confused about. Apart from Islam and maqasid syariah objectives, prisoners will also be shaped to love the country, respect the law, appreciate security and peace, and love their parents and family,” she said. Normah said the prisoners were also given exposure to skills that could generate income. “Here, they have the opportunity to learn business knowledge, with opportunities provided by government agencies such as micro-financing and micro business. “In short, the rehabilitation process is a comprehensive approach with the hope that when they are finally released, they will become citizens who are obedient to religion, the King and the country,” she said. Normah said that at the same time terrorism was a global issue that could not be addressed alone, but needed the cooperation of various parties to curb it. “Furthermore, in today’s world, there is vast human mobility due to improving transportation technology. It is only during the Covid-19 period that the movement was a bit stifled, but advanced communication technology makes communication so easy despite the far-flung distances. She said that increasing linkages within the world’s financial system also allows dispersal of funds, which is an advantage to the terrorists out there. At the international level, the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) was working with all security services to achieve the goal of fighting terrorism. “The same goes for the regional level or among ASEAN countries. However, at the national level, we need a planned approach so that early cases that are prone to extremism can be detected earlier so that effective mitigation action can be taken,” she said. According to her, Malaysians can be the eyes and ears of the police by reporting early signs or indicators of terrorist activity in the country. “On behalf of the PDRM, we pledge to perform our duties to the best of our ability, so that Malaysia does not become a target or a victim of acts of terrorism,” she said. — Bernama "

Melaka Contingent Police Headquarters Criminal Investigation Department chief ACP Mohd Sukri Kaman said forensic experts still require further information and have to run several lab tests to identify the actual cause of death. He said several specimens from the victim’s organs, including lungs, heart and liver were taken for testing and it will take a certain period of time before anything can be determined. He said there were injuries on the victim’s entire body, including the back, with old and new bruises in addition to new small wounds at the back of the victim’s head. “Initial investigations found the injuries were inflicted by a blunt object but further investigations will be conducted to determine if the injuries were caused by the victim himself due to a fall or by other individuals. “Therefore it is too early to confirm the cause of death of the victim due to abuse as was claimed previously,” he said when met with reporters outside Melaka Hospital here yesterday. Elaborating, he said the autopsy results found the victim passed away two hours before being found by the police in his house on the day of the incident, which contradicted claims by various parties that the body was found in a bloated condition. He said the boy’s remains were expected to be handed over to his legal guardians today after certain mandatory procedures were done. Mohd Sukri said the police had yet to receive any information about where the boy would be buried. On Friday, the seven-year-old boy died due to suspected abuse by his birth mother and stepfather in an incident in Taman Krubong Jaya here.

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigations Department Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants (Atipsom) D3 assistant director ACP Azry Akmar Ayob said this was because Malaysians still lacked awareness and understanding about the nature and criteria of forced labour crimes. Consequently, Malaysians are not aware that what they are doing or what is happening in front of them constitutes as forced labour and a violation of labour laws in the country. He, however, said that some parties, especially employers, would purposely violate labour laws by exploiting their workers. “(Take for) Example the modus operandi of a cleaning company. They bring in foreign workers, give them a place to stay before asking them to work without pay… and then they restrict the workers’ movements,” he told Bernama in Bukit Aman recently. He said although the focus was more on forced labour crimes, other forms of human trafficking, including sex exploitation by bringing in foreign women to work as prostitutes or guest relations officers, would not be neglected. Bernama had previously reported that the forced labour and sex exploitation categories were the biggest contributors of human trafficking cases in the country in 2019 and last year, with 418 cases. Besides sex exploitation and forced labour, the report also listed slavery, organ transplant and illegal activities, like the sale of babies, as human trafficking crimes under Section 2 of the Atipsom Act 2007. According to Azry Akmar, police hoped that by focusing on the issue of forced labour, it would help improve Malaysia’s ranking in the US State Department’s Annual Report, which placed Malaysia on the Tier 2 Watch List in 2020 regarding the issue. “We have implemented various approaches and efforts regarding this issue based on the policies, situation, sovereignty, culture and integrity of our country. “I do not deny that the report is a sign from the US to all of the countries in the world regarding the way we tackle the human trafficking issue but it is not proof that Malaysia is not doing something about it. We do it our way, maybe it’s different compared to the US,” he said. According to him, Tier 1 in the US State Department Annual Report meant that a country meets the minimum standards set while Tier 3 is the lowest, where a country shows no effort to curb cross-border crimes. He said that with the implementation of the Atipsom Act 2007, police, who are also one of the agencies placed under the Council for Anti-Trafficking in Persons, had the role of arresting, gathering intelligence and rescuing victims until the criminal suspects are charged in court. — Bernama "

He said this was based on the volume and value of the seizures made prior to this. “Investigations into the activity are being conducted under Section 505 (b) of the Penal Code for causing fear or alarm to the public. “In addition, the investigation includes those involved in the acquisition, storage, processing, smuggling, as well as those who manipulate, conspire and bring in the frozen meat through the Approved Permit (AP),” he said in a statement. Huzir said the police had so far received 13 reports from the public, who were upset following the raid on a warehouse in Senai, Johor, and revelations by the press about companies importing non-certified meat before re-packaging them as halal beef for the local market. “The police view this seriously and are committed to overcoming the issue with the cooperation of agencies such as the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs, the Department of Veterinary Services, the Department of Malaysian Quarantine Inspection Services and the Customs Department,” he said. He said the syndicate should be brought to justice as it had caused concern among Malaysians and touched on sensitive aspects of Islam. “The syndicate has also caused dissatisfaction and threatened the peace in the country due to the deceptive actions of the irresponsible parties, which also tarnishes the country’s image as a halal hub and has a big impact on the country’s economy,” he said.

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department director, Datuk Huzir Mohamed said the suspect’s tactic was to send a Direct Message to his loyal followers via his Instagram account in order to gain their attention. He said the suspect would invite his female followers to meet him for various reasons such as for a meal or business matters. “After asking them out, the suspect would trick them into going to his house and committed the sexual acts without the victim’s consent. “We recently received seven police reports against the celebrity with two investigation papers opened so far under Section 376 of the Penal Code for rape,” he said at a special news conference in Bukit Aman, here, yesterday. Huzir said another investigation paper was opened under Section 377C of the Penal Code for committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature and Section 354 for outraging modesty. He said police had also opened three more investigation papers under Section 354 of the Penal Code and received another report that was classified as no further action as there was no element of sexual harassment. “We believe more individuals will lodge a report on the preacher’s actions and I urge the victims to come forward and make a report,” he said, adding that most of the victims were university students. Consequently, Huzir said, the department formed a special task force to investigate the cases involving the suspect. Earlier yesterday, the remand order against the young preacher-cum-television celebrity was extended for another five days from today to facilitate the investigation into a rape case, following a report lodged by a 22-year-old student on Monday. The suspect was arrested on Friday following a separate report on rape lodged by another victim, aged 23, last Wednesday. — Bernama       "

Chief Judge of Malaya, Tan Sri Azahar Mohamed who delivered the court’s 8-1 majority decision said prescribing the measure of punishment was the prerogative of Parliament. He said the discretion to determine the measure of punishment was not an integral part of judicial power. “The court is only empowered to pass any sentence within the parameters of a prescribed sentence enacted by Parliament,” he said. A nine-member bench led by Court of Appeal president, Datuk Rohana Yusuf delivered their decision in the appeals brought by four individuals who raised the issue of constitutionality of the provisions in the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 (DDA) and Section 302 of the Penal Code which impose the mandatory death sentence for drug trafficking and murder, respectively. Except for Justice Nallini Pathmanathan who dissented, the other judges — Rohana, Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak Datuk Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, Federal Court judges Datuk Vernon Ong Lam Kiat, Datuk Abdul Rahman Sebli, Puan Sri Zaleha Yusof, Datuk Zabariah Md Yusof and Datuk Hasnah Mohammed Hashim — were with the majority decision. The decision was delivered by the court after almost four hours in a modified courtroom, the banquet hall of the Palace of Justice to comply with the social distancing rule. In his decision, Justice Azahar said the court could not, at its own pleasure, impose any sentence as it wished if the law did not permit it. “The power of sentencing is statutory and the court cannot exceed or limit the power of sentencing in the name of exercising its judicial power. “The provisions in Section 39B of the DDA and Section 302 of the Penal Code do not usurp the judicial power nor violate the doctrine of separation of powers. “In my opinion, any controversial matter of policy involving differing views on moral and social issues is one circumstance where Parliament is better placed to assess the needs of society and to make difficult choices between competing considerations. “In the context of Malaysian society, Parliament as the duly elected legislature is the appropriate body to decide on the appropriate measure of punishment for drug traffickers and murderers for what society regards as the most serious crime,” he said. Justice Azahar said it was only right that the decision and initiative to change or to abolish the mandatory death penalty should come from Parliament. In her dissenting decision, Justice Nallini said the legislative power of Parliament to prescribe punishment was subjected to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it did not transgress the supreme law of the land. “It allows the judiciary to retain a check and balance on both the Executive and Legislature by striking down law that does not conform to the Federal Constitution,” she said. “Section 39B of the DDA and Section 302 of the Penal Code are unconstitutional and therefore should be struck down. “I have concluded that the imposition of the mandatory death penalty is unconstitutional for infringement of Article 5 (1) (liberty of person) and Article 8 (1) (right to equal protection of the law) of the Federal Constitution,” she said. The Federal Court also decided on the merits of the appeals of the four individuals — South Africans Letitia Bosman and Benjamin William Hawkes, Peruvian Jorge Crespo Gomes and P. Pubalan, a Malaysian who owns a security company, who were appealing against their convictions and death sentences. For Bosman and Hawkes, the court affirmed their convictions for drug trafficking and death sentences. The court convicted Gomes on a lesser charge for possession of 779 grammes of cocaine and he was sentenced to 10 years’ jail to run from June 27, 2016, the date of his arrest. Meanwhile, the court set aside Pubalan’s conviction for murder of his brother-in-law D. Murali and convicted him for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

On top of that he said, most of them are believed to be linked to gangsters, thugs and secret societies. “In fact they can easily be identified by a certain symbol or logo which is pasted at the front side of their lorries, for easy recognition among them,” Mohd Zaki told Bernama recently. He also revealed there were also cases when SWCorp enforcement officers received threats while patrolling the illegal dumping sites and some had also been attacked by groups believed to be protectors of the areas. Elaborating he said, the presence and demand of illegal waste disposal sites had been influenced by among others, the cost factor, as these operators provided much cheaper and more ‘efficient’ services. “The prices charged by illegal landfill operators vary. Normally it will depend on the types of wastes to be transported and the price could further be negotiated to be around RM10 to RM60 per trip,” he said. In citing the price charged for legal waste disposal in Kuala Lumpur, he said the charge at the Bukit Tagar Landfill is RM49 per tonne (for inert waste only); Sungai Kertas Inert Landfill (RM11 per tonne) while in Putrajaya at the Dengkil Inert Landfill (RM10 per tonne) and Tanjung 12 Landfill (RM55 per tonne). Based on records and receipt books seized in most Ops Sampah Haram (illegal wastes operation), Mohd Zaki said the illegal landfill operators’ takings depended on frequency of lorries’ arrival at the sites. “In the active areas, total profits were estimated to be over RM1,000 per day and at the less active (areas), they could still earn a few hundreds per day,” said Mohd Zaki. Asked regarding the operators’ modus operandi, he said based on intelligence reports, operators would first identify locations which were seen to be suitable as dumping sites. “Normally they would choose an abandoned and secluded area, regardless whether the land belongs to the government, an individual, reserved land or land without ownership,” he said. After identifying the location, the operator would encroach onto the land, start clearing and digging to fill in the rubbish before covering and leveling the site when the maximum capacity is reached. Some of them even install fencing to hide their activities, as they take in all types of wastes, as long as they are paid according to the price fixed, he added. “Subsequently they will start informing the waste disposal lorry drivers on the existence of the new landfill site via certain WhatsApp group,” he said, adding that some would contact or meet the drivers personally. According to Mohd Zaki, five illegal disposal hotspots around the city centre at Jalan Gombak, next to KL Traders Square, adjacent to the MRT project: Jalan 1/40, Pintasan Segambut, Mukim Batu: Jalan Besi Kawi, Sungai Besi; Jalan 1/141, Kampung Malaysia Tambahan and Taman Danau Desa have been closed after stern action were action. A total of 2,579 illegal dumping sites were detected and shut down from 2014 until April this year. From January to April this year, SWCorp had conducted 798 Ops Sampah Haram, in collaboration with other enforcement agencies. — Bernama "

https://selangorjournal.my/2020/06/verdict-in-kevin-morais-murder-case-on-july-10/,Verdict in Kevin Morais murder case on July 10,2020-06-11T18:09:30+08:00,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 — The High Court here today set July 10 for decision on six accused in the murder of deputy public prosecutor Datuk Anthony Kevin Morais whose body was found in a barrel filled with concrete five years ago. Judge Datuk Azman Abdullah set the date after the submissions by both parties at the end of the defence case. The trial began on April 6, 2016, with 84 witnesses, including 14 from the defence, called to testify. Lawyer Datuk N. Sivananthan, representing pathologist Colonel Dr R. Kunaseegaran, 57, who is the first accused, in his submission, among others, said that the evidence presented by the prosecution was insufficient to convict his client with the murder charge and that the motive raised by the prosecution did not prove his client was guilty. “The motive raised by the prosecution is that the first accused (Kunaseegaran) allegedly held a grudge against the deceased and had planned and carried out the assassination of the deceased is fictitious and on assumptions. “In fact, the first accused testified during the defence that the deceased had actually helped him (in another case in the Shah Alam Court,” he added. He said even prosecution witnesses never claimed that his client had quarrelled, uttered any abusive remarks or expressed dissatisfaction with Morais, and that investigating officer himself had confirmed that there was no evidence in the case to show any dispute between his client and the victim. The lawyer said that there was no evidence provided by the prosecution to support the use of Section 34 of the Penal Code, because in proving that section, the prosecution had to show a joint intention among all the accused to commit the offence. “It is an undisputed fact that the first accused was nowhere to be found in connection with the murder and disposal of the deceased Kevin Morais on September 3, 2015 and September 4, 2015, in addition to the record of the first accused proving that he was in the Klang area on the day of the incident (September 4, 2015) and the phone records show that the first accused had never communicated with any other accused during the assassination and at any time, ” he added. Meanwhile, lawyer Datuk Sheelan Arjunan, who represented the other five accused — R. Dinishwaran, A. K. Thinesh Kumar, M. Vishwanath, S. Nimalan and S. Ravi Chandaran — among other things, raised the question of the existence of an unknown deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) derived from a wire used to bind a gun in which Morais’ body was found. “According to the testimony of the chemist, he claimed to have tested the DNA with 11 detainees including the DNA of all the accused. This is the question of who’s DNA is on the wires? There is a possibility that the DNA is that of the actual killer, and if the accused had indeed killed the victim, their DNA would be on the wire. The DNA of the unknown person shows that there is another individual involved. “Until today, the prosecution has failed to show where the victim was killed or who killed. There is no evidence to link the accused with the murder and there is no evidence that the accused killed the victim,” he added. Deputy public prosecutor Saiful Edris Zainuddin, who is prosecuting in the case with deputy public prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin, said although Kunaseegaran was not seen anywhere in the murder case, the witness’s testimony showed the accused had motives in the killing. He said the accused should ‘unite’ to oppose the prosecution’s argument, but they had blamed one another when giving their evidence. “The fact is that the prosecution’s ‘ammunition’ cannot be rebutted (by the defence) and there was no conclusion unless the prosecution succeeded in proving the case under Section 302 of the Penal Code,” he added. On the existence of the DNA of an unknown person, Wan Shaharuddin argued that the court cannot ignore other evidence that had been adduced in court. “The defence did not specify the testimony by the chemists that the DNA is weak. The chemist testified that many people handled the sack, among them the police, Civil Defence Department, where some of them wore gloves and some did not. The wire did not kill the victim, it only exists after the incident (murder). “As such, it is safe for them to prosecute all the accused because all the evidence do not favor them and the testimony by all the accused is merely a denial and an afterthought,” he added. Kunaseegaran, 57, Ravi Chandran, 49, Dinishwaran, 28; Thinesh Kumar, 27; Vishwanath, 30; and Nimalan, 27, are charged with murdering Morais somewhere along Jalan Dutamas Raya Sentul and No. 1, Jalan USJ 1/6D, Subang Jaya, at between 7am and 8pm on Sept 4, 2015. They were charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34 of the same law, and face the mandatory death sentence if convicted. — Bernama "

Stop the habit of going out of the house with an unreasonable excuse for buying breakfast. Buy some groceries and make breakfast for the whole family and keep them safe at home,” he stressed.

He had also urged motorists to give their fullest cooperation to the authorities manning the roadblocks. “I would like to make a personal appeal to those who attended the tabligh gathering to come out for the Covid-19 screening procedure. We know who you are. If you do not comply with the instructions the long arms of the law will come to you,” he added.

Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Huzir Mohamed said initial investigations carried out from Jan 24 found that the rumours and false news were circulated through four Facebook accounts and one WhatsApp group. He said three cases involving Facebook users by the name of ‘Ibu Yati’, ‘Roti Sardeen’, and ‘Gabungan Anak Terengganu (Original)’ and the WhatsApp group were being investigated under Section 505 (b) of the Penal Code for publishing and circulating rumours likely to cause fear or alarm to the public, and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 for improper use of network facilities. “The other case involving a Facebook user by the name of ‘Mr Kong Tuck Wah’ is related to the police report on the viral issue of coronavirus and the case is being investigated under Section 203A of the Penal Code for disclosure of information and also Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998,” he said in a statement here today. He said among the rumours and false news circulated was on the sudden death of a prisoner in Sandakan, Sabah, allegedly after being infected by coronavirus. Huzir said there were also false reports being circulated about several individuals suspected of coronavirus receiving treatment at the Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital, Kuala Terengganu. “The spread of this false news can cause fear or alarm to the public and the government is taking all the necessary action to tackle the issue appropriately,” he said. As such, he said members of the public are advised to stop spreading any types of unofficial or unverified news, articles or statements on the issue as legal action and punishment awaited those who tried to be a ‘hero’ by committing that offence on the Internet and social media. Yesterday, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador also called on the public to stop circulating false news on the threat of the 2019 novel coronavirus in the country, and instead to refer to the Ministry of Health for the latest development on the matter. — Bernama "
