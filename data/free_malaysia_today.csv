Cops expand Farah Kartini murder probe to farm linked to suspect | FMT,FMT Reporters,2024-07-20T15:11:49+08:00,"PETALING JAYA: Police continued their investigation into the murder of Nur Farah Kartini Abdullah by expanding their search for evidence to a tapioca farm purportedly linked to the sole suspect, who is a policeman.
Hulu Selangor deputy police chief Asri Yunus said it is believed the suspect manages the farm at Kampung Klan Halt in Slim River, Perak, on a part-time basis, Bernama reported.
A team of forensic officers was joined by personnel from the Hulu Selangor police’s criminal investigation division at the farm.
Asri said police were also inspecting a Toyota seized when the suspect, a 26-year-old lance corporal, was arrested, as well as his SIM card.
However, the search for evidence at Sungai Trolak in Kampung Batu 4, Slim River was called off because of bad weather, which also led to strong river currents.
Farah, who was reported missing on July 10, was found dead at an oil palm plantation in Kampung Sri Kledang, Hulu Selangor, on the evening of July 15.
She had gone missing after delivering a rental car to a customer.
Police later arrested the suspect, who is based in Perak, and remanded him until July 22 to assist in their murder probe under Section 302 of the Penal Code.

"Teacher loses RM135,000 to phone scam | FMT",FMT Reporters,2024-07-20T07:24:38+08:00,"PETALING JAYA: Despite frequent warnings in the mass media, a teacher in Rompin lost RM135,150 after being deceived by a phone scam syndicate.
Pahang police chief Yahaya Othman said the 25-year-old woman received a phone call from a person claiming to be an officer from the network blocking division of the digital communications department on July 2, Bernama reported.
He said the victim was told she had committed an offence by misusing her phone line in Perak.
The phone call was then connected to a man posing as a police officer who later persuaded the victim to transfer money for the purpose of the investigation and to avoid prosecution.
Yahaya said the victim took out a personal loan for RM128,000 and used her savings to make 11 transactions to six different bank accounts resulting in losses amounting to RM135,150.
Yahaya said the victim later realised she had been duped and lodged a report at the Rompin district police headquarters yesterday.
He advised the public to be always aware of scammers and check on suspicious calls by contacting the police or government agencies to avoid becoming victims of fraud.

French cops nab knife-wielding assailant on terrorism charges | FMT,Reuters,2024-07-19T07:35:30+08:00,"PARIS: French police arrested today a man on terrorism charges accused of trying to murder a taxi driver with a knife while expressing support for Palestinian resistance group Hamas, a source at the terrorism prosecutor’s office said.
France is in its highest state of security as it gears up to host millions of visitors, athletes and world leaders during the Paris Olympic Summer Games, kicking off on July 26.
The man, already known by authorities as someone who had been radicalised, stopped a taxi on Tuesday night while brandishing a gun in the city of Le Mans, and asked to be taken to an isolated area near Ferte-Bernard.
He then forced the driver out of the car, bound him and attacked his neck with the blade, the source said.
The driver managed to escape to a local resident’s home, where he was eventually treated by emergency services.
The assailant was arrested early this morning in Yvelines, west of Paris, the source said.
He is being investigated on terrorism, attempted murder and kidnapping charges, the source said.
Yesterday, a police officer was critically injured in a stabbing attack in Paris’ Champs Elysees shopping district, in the latest in a string of unrelated security incidents in the French capital this week.
A soldier was stabbed and wounded by a man armed with a knife at a railway station on Monday.
Authorities are also investigating whether a man who rammed a car into the terrace of a cafe on Wednesday evening did so deliberately.

"Cabinet to set up special committee on cyberbullying, says Fahmi | FMT",Bernama,2024-07-19T05:50:56+08:00,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Cabinet today agreed to establish a special committee to address cyberbullying, communications minister Fahmi Fadzil said.
The unity government spokesman said the committee would comprise representatives from the communications, home and digital ministries, plus the Prime Minister’s Department’s legal affairs division.
He said the committee would also be supported by a special team drawn from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, police and Attorney-General’s Chambers.
“The Cabinet is of the view that there should be sterner action against social media platforms in cyberbullying issues. They cannot just wash their hands, they must be equally responsible for tackling such issues.
We will look comprehensively at the legal aspects and amendments, as well as any other actions we feel are necessary to deal with the issue of cyberbullying, he said after the full rehearsal of Sultan Ibrahim’s installation ceremony at Istana Negara today.
He also said the committee would need to leverage all expertise available to deal with cyberbullying as such acts occur across multiple social media platforms and utilise artificial intelligence.
He added that participation was not exclusive to the stakeholders mentioned and welcomed the involvement of other ministries.
He said the issue was raised at the Cabinet level at the request of Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was reportedly concerned about TikTok influencer A Rajeswary, better known as Esha, who allegedly committed suicide due to cyberbullying.
The body of the 29-year-old influencer was found in her home last month.
Fahmi said the main problem in dealing with cyberbullying was that most perpetrators hide behind fake accounts, making them difficult to identify.

NGO slams ‘delayed justice’ for assaulted disabled driver | FMT,Faisal Asyraf,2024-07-19T04:23:13+08:00,"PUTRAJAYA: The NGO representing a disabled e-hailing driver who was allegedly assaulted by a police escort to Johor regent Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has lamented the delay in justice for the victim.
Deaf Advocacy and Wellbeing National Organisation Malaysia co-founder Anthony Chong said the case had not progressed towards prosecution despite clear evidence and testimonies from witnesses.
“The police warned the victim not to share the video of the assault, which he complied with, yet justice has been delayed.
“We urge the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to take immediate and decisive action by prosecuting the perpetrators of the assault.
By doing so, the AGC will reinforce its commitment to justice and equality, ensuring that the deaf community feels safe and supported by the legal system, Chong said in a memorandum.
About 10 members of the NGO, including the victim Ong Ing Keong, submitted the memorandum to the AGC at its office here this morning.
Ong, who is deaf and mute, was reportedly assaulted by the perpetrator while waiting to pick up passengers at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur on May 28.
Tunku Ismail subsequently urged the police to carry out a thorough investigation of the incident.
The case was investigated under Section 323 for causing voluntary hurt.
Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain previously said the police had recorded statements from a dozen individuals. According to him, the investigation paper was referred to the AGC on June 14.

50% discount on police summonses at Merdeka month launch | FMT,FMT Reporters,2024-07-18T11:43:39+08:00,"PETALING JAYA: Road users with pending traffic police summonses may receive up to 50% in discounts at the launch of the Merdeka month celebrations on Sunday.
The information department said the launch will be held at Cyber Event Hall in Cyberjaya, with the booth for traffic summonses open from 9am to 4.30pm.
The event will also see a Madani sale of agricultural produce, held by the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority.
An Ehsan Rahmah Madani sale of essential items will also be held. Six main products will be on sale – chicken, fish, beef, eggs, 5kg bottled cooking oil and 5kg bags of rice.
Previously, road safety experts had urged Putrajaya to halt offering discounts for traffic summonses, saying it would only make drivers disregard traffic laws.
Police said these discounts encourage more traffic offenders to settle their outstanding summonses.
Most recently, police offered a 50% discount on traffic summonses during a three-day event in December to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Madani government.
However, the long queues left hundreds frustrated and waiting for hours to pay the discounted rates.

IPCC has received 348 complaints since its establishment in July last year | FMT,FMT Reporters,2024-07-18T11:18:16+08:00,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Independent Police Conduct Commission (IPCC) has received 348 complaints since its establishment on July 1, 2023, the Dewan Rakyat was told today.
Home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said out of that number, seven complaints are still being investigated by the commission, reported Bernama.
“One case involved a complaint made by a policeman against a superior because no action was taken on a previous complaint.
Among the seven complaints are integrity issues, including problems with the recruitment process for the rank of inspector and allegations of sexual harassment, he said during ministers’ question time.
He was responding to Ramkarpal Singh (PH-Bukit Gelugor), who asked about the number of complaints received against police officers pursuant to the IPCC Act and what action had been taken.
Saifuddin said Section 25 of the Act allows the complaints filed to be referred to other enforcement authorities.
This allows the IPCC to channel the complaints (to other agencies). If it involves elements of corruption, then the IPCC can channel it to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, he said.
He said that out of the 348 complaints, the largest number involved criminal elements, including violence, sexual harassment, drugs, forgery of documents, threats, as well as issues related to integrity, which fall under the purview of the Police Act 1967.
Responding to Ramkarpal’s follow-up question on whether the government planned to strengthen the IPCC’s role to handle complaints against police officers, Saifuddin said the ministry is allowing the commission, which has only been operational for a year, the space and trust to function effectively.
The principle that we hold to is that the law is dynamic, not static, until a certain period when it becomes untenable. But for now, we think it’s sufficient, he said.

July 29 decision on judicial review into Beng Hock’s death | FMT,FMT Reporters,2024-07-18T10:34:21+08:00,"KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court has set July 29 to deliver its ruling on a judicial review application brought by the family of Teoh Beng Hock against the police over his death in 2009.
Lawyer Harshaan Zamani, a member of the legal team representing Beng Hock’s father Teoh Leong Hwee and mother Teng Shuw Hoi, said oral submissions were made before Justice Wan Ahmad Farid Wan Salleh on June 4.
Finally, a decision will be delivered, although the application was filed quite some time back, he told FMT.
The High Court had on June 16, 2022 granted the family leave to file an application for judicial review, six months after the application was filed.
The late Beng Hock’s parents are seeking a court order to compel the inspector-general of police (IGP) to carry out a complete investigation into their son’s death.
The government, the IGP and the Bukit Aman criminal investigation department director have been named as respondents in the application.
The couple is also seeking several declarations, including one that states the police were negligent for failing to complete the probe within a reasonable time.
Teng, in her affidavit, said the police had failed to investigate Beng Hock’s death despite a Court of Appeal ruling in the family’s favour in 2014.
She said the police had formed three separate task forces – in 2011, 2014, and 2018 – supposedly to investigate the death and the last update on the status of the investigation was provided in 2021.
In 2014, a three-member Court of Appeal bench ruled that Beng Hock’s death was caused by the act of a person or persons unknown, including Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) officers, who had questioned him overnight before he was found dead.
The High Court had also recorded an out-of-court settlement, in which the family was awarded RM600,000 in damages for negligence.
Beng Hock, then a political aide to Selangor executive councillor and DAP’s Seri Kembangan assemblyman Ean Yong Hian Wah, was found dead on the fifth-floor service corridor of Plaza Masalam in Shah Alam on July 16, 2009.
He had been held there overnight and questioned by MACC, which had its Selangor headquarters on the 14th floor of the building.
An RCI in 2011 determined that Beng Hock had been driven to suicide by MACC’s aggressive questioning.

Central Paris locks down for Olympics as athletes arrive | FMT,AFP,2024-07-18T03:52:54+08:00,"PARIS: French security forces began locking down large parts of central Paris today ahead of the hugely complex Olympics opening ceremony next week on the river Seine.
The opening parade along 6km of the river led to the closure of riverside central districts to most vehicles from 5am local time today.
Anyone wanting to enter the highest-security grey zone along both banks of the Seine, such as residents or tourists with hotel reservations in the area, will need a security pass in the form of a QR code.
The City of Light is transforming ahead of the July 26-Aug 11 Olympics when around 10 million spectators are expected.
Temporary sports stadiums have sprung up at popular locations such as the Eiffel Tower, the Invalides or the Place de la Concorde, while new Olympic VIP lanes are the latest traffic-snarling addition.
It’s true that our concept of having a large number of temporary sites in the heart of the city, obviously with that, there are constraints, but I feel like people are seeing what we’re doing, Paris 2024 director-general Etienne Thobois told AFP last month.
Many central Metro stations will also be closed today until the day after the opening ceremony, which will see 6,000-7,000 athletes sail down the Seine on around a hundred barges and river boats.
It will be the first time a Summer Olympics has opened outside the main athletics stadium, with up to 500,000 people set to watch in person from stands, on the river banks and from the overlooking apartments.
Village opens
The vast security operation has been giving senior police officers cold sweats ever since it was announced in 2021 because of the difficulty of securing so many spectators in such a large, densely packed urban area.
Around 45,000 officers are set to be on duty for the July 26 parade, assisted by thousands of soldiers and private security agents.
On Wednesday, police in eastern France announced they had arrested a suspected far-right extremist who had made threats against the Games in a group on the Telegram phone application.
The installation of tens of thousands of metal security barriers all along the opening ceremony route in Paris has outraged some residents, who feel closed in.
It’s a bit like being in Planet of the Apes, Aissa Yago, who lives on the Ile Saint Louis in central Paris, told AFP this week from behind a barrier. All they need to do is throw us some peanuts.
Elsewhere today, the first athletes are set to arrive to take up residence in the newly built Olympic Village in a northern suburb of the capital.
Comprising around 40 different low-rise housing blocs, the complex has been built as a showcase of innovative construction techniques using low-carbon concrete, water recycling and reclaimed building materials.
It was intended to be free of air-conditioning, although Olympic delegations have ordered around 2,500 portable cooling units for their athletes out of fear of the impact of high temperatures on their performances.
The major countries are going to arrive on the first day … so Great Britain, the US, New Zealand, Brazil, Switzerland, the deputy head of the French delegation, Andre-Pierre Goubert, told AFP.
At full capacity, the village will host 14,500 people including 9,000 athletes.
The Olympics will be followed by the Paralympics from Aug 28-Sept 8.

Thai cops say cyanide killed 6 foreigners in Bangkok hotel | FMT,Reuters,2024-07-17T06:09:04+08:00,"BANGKOK: Cyanide poisoning was likely the cause of the deaths of six foreigners whose bodies were found in a room in a plush Bangkok hotel, with the suspected killer among the dead, Thai police said on Wednesday
The rapid-acting, deadly chemical was found on drinking glasses and a teapot in the room at the luxury Grand Hyatt Erawan hotel, and interviews with relatives of the dead revealed there had been a dispute over debt related to an investment, police said.
The six were all of Vietnamese ethnicity, two of those US nationals, and were found dead late on Tuesday. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation had assisted police with the investigation, police said.
We found cyanide in the teacups, all six cups we found cyanide, Trirong Phiwpan, Commander of the Thai police evidence office, told a press conference.
After staff brought tea cups and two hot water bottles, milk and tea pots… one of the six introduced cyanide. The results of an autopsy were expected within the next day, police said.
Vietnam’s government said its embassy in Bangkok was closely coordinating with Thai authorities on the case, while the US state department said it was monitoring the situation and local authorities were responsible for the investigation.
The Grand Hyatt Erawan, operated by Erawan Group, has over 350 rooms and is located in a popular tourist district known for luxury shopping and restaurants.
News of the deaths, initially reported by some Thai media as a shooting, could be a setback for Thailand as it bets heavily on its vital tourism sector reviving an economy that has struggled since the pandemic.
Thailand is expecting 35 million foreign arrivals this year, up from 28 million last year who spent 1.2 trillion baht (US$33.71 billion).
Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin on Tuesday urged a swift probe into the issue to limit the impact on Thailand’s travel sector.

Cops call Teoh Beng Hock group members in for questioning | FMT,FMT Reporters,2024-07-17T06:06:29+08:00,"PETALING JAYA: Police have summoned three members of the Teoh Beng Hock Association for Democratic Advancement (TBH-ADA) to give their statements under the Peaceful Assembly Act 2012, the group said.
TBH-ADA chairman Ng Yap Hwa said the Brickfields police headquarters called him and fellow members, Wong Yan Ke and Wong Voon How, to give their statements at 5.30pm today.
Ng said the group would also lodge a report at the same station alleging police violence.
On Monday, at the climax of the group’s walk of justice, a handful of members tried to gain access to Parliament and were intercepted by police. There was a brief scuffle, during which Teoh’s sister Lee Lan fell to the ground and was apparently hurt.
Ng also claimed that one woman – a member of the demonstration’s organising committee – was grabbed at the collar by a policeman, which broke her necklace and left red marks on her neck.
After a brief stand-off, the group was able to submit the memorandum but could not enter the building as originally planned.
Ng said the group planned to bill the government and request compensation for the damage to the necklace and medical treatment.
On May 5, the group launched a campaign called The Search for Missing Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Kuala Kubu Bharu, following multiple failed attempts by the family to meet Anwar since he took office.
In 2009, Teoh, the former aide to then Selangor executive councillor Ean Yong Hian Wah, was found dead on the fifth floor of Plaza Masalam in Shah Alam, hours after he arrived for questioning on the 14th floor of the Selangor Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission headquarters.
A coroner’s inquest in 2011 delivered an open verdict, and his family subsequently filed an appeal against the findings. Three years later, the Court of Appeal set aside the open verdict and ruled that Teoh’s death was caused by multiple injuries as a result of unlawful acts by unknown persons.

He said the Sungai Buloh Hospital forensic department pathologist required laboratory analysis results from several biological samples from the remains to ascertain the cause of death.
“Due to the decomposition, especially in the chest and face, experts are currently unable to confirm the cause of death.
Once we receive the laboratory analysis results, the experts can proceed with determining the cause of death, he told reporters today.
Hussein also confirmed that a Toyota car belonging to the suspect, an acquaintance of Farah’s, had been seized for further investigation.
Farah’s body was discovered in an oil palm plantation area in Kampung Sri Kledang, Hulu Selangor, at around 6pm on Monday.
She was reported missing on July 10 after delivering a rental car to a customer.
A 26-year-old man, also a policeman stationed in Perak, was subsequently arrested and remanded for seven days until July 22 to assist in the investigation under Section 302 of the Penal Code.

"Police won’t protect officer remanded in Sarawakian’s murder, says IGP | FMT",FMT Reporters,2024-07-16T11:57:26+08:00,"PETALING JAYA: Inspector-General of Police Razarudin Husain says police will not protect a policeman who has been remanded on suspicion of being involved in the murder of a 25-year-old woman.
Nur Farah Kartini Abdullah, who went missing last week, was found dead at an oil palm estate in Kampung Sri Kledang, Hulu Selangor, yesterday.
We will not allow this case to tarnish the police’s image, he told Sinar Harian when asked about a lance corporal who was arrested to assist in the murder probe.
“Our stance is clear – your rank or position does not matter.
Police officers who commit crimes will face justice for their action. Don’t expect us to protect them, he said, adding that the police will conduct a transparent and fair investigation.
Razarudin also reminded all police personnel that they have taken oaths to serve the public and uphold the law.
Remember this oath and realise that your actions can affect the entire police force.
Earlier today, Sinar Harian reported that the 26-year-old suspect had been remanded for seven days from today to assist in the investigation.
He had been stationed at the Slim River police station in Perak for the past five years.
The man was arrested by police yesterday, not long after Farah’s body was discovered. She was reportedly murdered by someone she knew.
Farah, from Sarawak, was reported missing at about 2am on July 10 after delivering a rental car to a customer at Felda Gedangsa in Hulu Selangor.

Spanish rescuers find remains thought to be of missing British teen | FMT,Reuters,2024-07-15T15:20:22+08:00,"MADRID: A rescue team on the Spanish island of Tenerife today found human remains in the area where British teenager Jay Slater went missing nearly a month ago and evidence strongly suggests they are his, police said.
The Guardia Civil police force said in a statement that he may have died due to a fall in the difficult-to-access mountainous area, but that an autopsy would confirm whether it was an accident.
A police spokesman said the body was found this morning by a Civil Guard mountain rescue group.
The family has been notified and an autopsy will take place shortly, with the case then being transferred to a Tenerife court to determine the cause of death, the spokesman said.
Slater, 19, went missing on June 17 and his phone was last traced to the Masca ravine in a remote national park on the Canary Islands archipelago.
On June 30, Spanish police said they had ended a search for Slater that had involved dozens of officers, rescue workers and volunteers using dogs, drones and a helicopter.
However, today they said Guardia Civil officers had maintained a continuous and discrete search in the area for the whole 29 days.
The family could not be reached immediately for comment.
British overseas missing persons charity LBT Global, which has carried several statements on behalf of the family, said in an email that the body found looks to be that of Jay Slater.
The remains were found with Slater’s possessions and clothes and it is understood it was discovered close to the site of his mobile phone’s last location, LBT Global said.
Slater’s mother, Debbie, said on July 13 the family had arranged for a team of experts with specialist dogs to fly in over the weekend from the Netherlands.
Jay is just a normal hardworking young lad from Lancashire who is very loved by all who know him, she wrote in a statement, asking people to pray for him and his family.
