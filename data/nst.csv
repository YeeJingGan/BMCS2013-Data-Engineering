Syndicate members lead lavish lives trafficking wild birds,Mohd Jamilul Anbia Md Denin,"July 14, 2024 @ 3:54pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Some people lead lavish lives and own assets worth hundreds of thousands of ringgit by selling protected wild birds. The Department of Wildlife and National Parks (Perhilitan) Peninsular Malaysia discovered this when it detained syndicate members and bird enthusiasts selling wild birds on social media. Some suspects owned a Toyota Vellfire MPV, luxury homes and monthly incomes reaching tens of thousands of ringgit. Perhilitan director-general Datuk Abdul Kadir Abu Hashim said some suspects were only clerks or were unemployed but had luxurious lives. He said these people bought birds from middlemen or those who caught serindit, murai batu, bayan puling and other species before advertising them on social media. ""Some birds were bought for between RM500 and RM1,000 each. They were then sold to enthusiasts for up to RM5,000 each. ""Though this may seem like a waste of money, only bird enthusiasts understand this hobby. They are willing to spend a lot of money to own birds with the best chirps."" He said Perhilitan conducted many initiatives to curb the illegal hunting of wild birds. ""We've achieved many successes with Op Khazanah to combat wildlife crimes and forest encroachment. We did this with the help of the police and Customs Department."" He said Perhilitan also worked the Peninsular Malaysia Forestry Department, Perak State Parks Corporation and Johor State Parks Corporation to curb these activities. ""Wildlife crime is ranked fourth among global crimes. ""Interpol estimates that wildlife smuggling generates an income of US$20 billion annually."" Kadir said high demand among bird enthusiasts domestically and internationally caused the prices of certain bird species to rise. ""Among the protected wild birds popular with syndicates are murai batu, serindit, kelicap kunyit, burung daun, burung sanwu, hua mei, cockatoos and barau-barau. ""Perhilitan has seized birds worth more than RM3 million since 2019."""

"Panic, prayers as shooter starts firing at Trump rally",Afp,"July 14, 2024 @ 2:07pm","BUTLER: A string of pops sent a crowd of thousands of Donald Trump supporters diving for cover as the Secret Service rushed to protect the man they had waited hours in the sun to see. A lectern emblazoned with the former president's name was knocked sideways, and the crowd gasped as agents lifted the 78-year-old Republican back to his feet after storming the stage. Applause and cheering spread through the rural Pennsylvania fairground as Trump, clearly dazed, pumped his fist and waved through the linked arms of his security detail at the stunned crowd. Officers gestured to his waiting motorcade, while an agent wearing a ballistic helmet and clutching a rifle scoured the crowd at Trump's feet. The crowd chanted ""USA, USA,"" as an unsteady Trump was led down the handful of steps from the stage to his waiting armoured SUV. ""They won't take you down,"" shouted a man in the crowd as Trump's guardsmen formed a human chain to deliver him to safety, his fist still raised even as he was eased into the vehicle. Erin Autenreith said she was ""sitting in the first row in the middle. I was right in front of Trump."" ""I was so excited. I just looked at him. Then I heard these pops. It sounded like a July 4 thing, pop, pop, pop,"" said the 66-year-old from Glenshaw, Pennsylvania. ""But when they all jumped on the stage, they surrounded him and put him down. That's when we realized it must have been really a shot. ""Then more people came and they cleared the area,"" added Autenreith, who was attending her sixth Trump rally and had been volunteering at the gathering all day. ""Then they were talking to each other. 'Left clear. Right clear.' Then they got him up. And he said, ""I gotta get my shoes on.'"" She said those words – which were caught by Trump's microphone and audible in footage of the incident – were the first he spoke. ""And I saw on his cheek, on the right side, because he came up straight, I saw a little bit of blood,"" Autenreith said. ""He turned and I could see it from the ear. And then he put his arm up with a fist pump,"" she added. Trump said in a Truth Social post later that he was ""shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear."" As the enormity of what had happened sunk in, tempers rose in the crowd. Some Trump supporters hurled abuse at the media, conspicuous in the middle of the fairground. ""This is what you wanted, isn't it,"" said one man who declined to give his name. Dozens of people made vulgar gestures towards the corner of the fairground from where the gunshots appeared to have come from. The shooter was ""outside the grounds,"" Butler County district attorney Richard Goldinger said. ""Let's go people. Let's go,"" screamed one Secret Service officer as officials sought to evacuate the thousands of rally-goers. ""This is an active crime scene,"" said another, as a police helicopter flew overhead and a large police truck marked ""Explosives"" maneuvered through the mass of people. Others berated organizers for the apparent lapse in security. ""Nice way to organize a perimeter,"" shouted one woman as she left. Another woman who had seen the chaos unfold on the stage was sobbing uncontrollably, asking about Trump's wellbeing. A group knelt and prayed near the back of the field. ""When they got him up, I got the impression they wanted to hustle him off the stage and he wanted to stay there and raise his fist to the world,"" said sales worker Blake Marnell, 59, who had been in the front row. Marnell, who attends Trump rallies in a signature brick wall suit in reference to the Republican's border policies, said: ""I never thought I would see this happen."" When he turned back to the podium, he said, Trump was ""covered"" by the Secret Service. ""I could not see him ... but I could tell they were over him. ""I did see blood above his right ear. It's unclear – I can't say where that came from."" ""It's an incredibly sad day,"" added a visibly emotional Marnell, who is from San Diego, California. ""Just say a word for him to whoever you think is appropriate."" — AFP"

""In this instance especially, customers who have made their bill payments and do not have outstanding balances should contact the water company directly to verify if they receive such tags on their water meters,"" he said. Ramli reminded the public not to panic in such situations and always refer to the proper channels for verification. The image being circulated shows a red tag with the Air Selangor logo and a QR Code on it. The image is accompanied by a caption claiming that a tenant had his water supply suddenly cut, so he went out to check and saw this red tag. It also claimed that the QR code led to a website which at first glance looked like a legitimate Air Selangor website, but was not. ""It's a scam, like many other imitation website. ""Turns out the tap was turned off manually. Air Selangor doesn't operate this way,"" the caption read. Air Selangor has clarified via a post on its official Facebook page on Friday night that the tags were being used by its company, but only on customers who have outstanding bills. ""Following what is being circulated on social media, Air Selangor wants to clarify that the notices in question are currently being used for customers who have outstanding bills. ""For customers who do not have any outstanding bills who also receive the notice, contact Air Selangor at 15300 or direct enquiries to our Help Centre via the www.airselangor.com web portal and Air Selangor application,"" it said in a statement."
Reports: Govt says MACC trio acted without authorisation in case involving Chinese nationals,New Straits Times,"July 13, 2024 @ 12:13am","KUALA LUMPUR: The government has distanced itself from three Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) officers accused of robbing and extorting bribes from a Chinese national, reports said. In the report published by FMT, the government, in its defence to a lawsuit filed by Chinese national Gao Kun, said that three officers identified as Fahmee Nor, Azwad Asli, and Haffiz Radzi acted independently and that the raid in question was not part of their official duties. The government also said that there is no record of any investigation conducted on Gao, and the officers did not have authorization for the raid. According to the report, the government also asserted its right to seek indemnity from the trio for any liabilities towards Gao, who is a permanent resident under the Malaysia My Second Home programme. In the lawsuit filed by Gao on May 14, he named the government, the three officers, the MACC chief commissioner, and a politician and his wife as defendants. In his statement of claim, he alleged that the politician and his wife were involved in a purported raid on his home on Dec 10, 2021. He claimed the raid was facilitated by a tip-off from the couple, who are close associates of his family. Gao also alleged that after the raid, the politician's wife visited his apartment, offering to ""settle"" the matter for RM10 million. He further claimed that the couple had borrowed RM2.1 million from him around Feb 17, 2021, which remains unpaid, and had repeatedly sought an additional RM10 million loan, which he refused. In December last year, the three MACC officers pleaded not guilty to charges of gang robbery in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court."

Jail for Malaysian smuggler who entered S'pore by mistake,The New Straits Times,"July 12, 2024 @ 8:24pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A man who tried to smuggle two Indonesian men into the country on a speedboat mistook Singapore for Kelantan. According to the Singapore-based English daily The Straits Times, the man thought he had arrived in Pasir Puteh when the speedboat was approaching a landmass, only to realise his mistake. However, it was too late, as they had already been spotted by Singapore's Police Coast Guard (PCG), who gave them a chase for entering Singaporean waters at around 5.30am on April 25. The pursuit lasted for 17 minutes before the man's speedboat capsized from taking on too much water. The man who was only identified as Afendy today (July 12) was sentenced to 22 weeks' jail and three strokes of the cane after pleading guilty to two charges under the Immigration Act and a third charge of navigating his speedboat in a manner so rash as to endanger human life. The report added that another two charges under the Act were taken into consideration for his sentencing. Deputy Public Prosecutor Intan Suhaily Abu Bakar said that while the harm caused in this case is low, Afendy's culpability is high. The PCG, Suhaily said, had turned on their sirens and blinkers to signal for the accused to stop but he ignored the warnings and chose to flee. She added that the PCG craft had to manoeuvre in a zig-zag manner to pursue the accused and the chase ended only when the speedboat capsized. Afendy, who was unrepresented in court, pleaded for leniency in mitigation, on the grounds that he has family to support. Meanwhile, the two Indonesians that Affendy sought smuggled into Malaysia who were identified as Muhli and Sanapiah, aged 37 and 32 respectively, were sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment and three strokes of the cane."
Lim seeks dismissal of graft charges linked to undersea tunnel project,Dawn Chan,"July 12, 2024 @ 8:02pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former Penang chief minister Lim Guan Eng is seeking to have his four corruption charges related to the undersea tunnel project dismissed.

The testimony was related to a RM19 million cheating case involving businessman G. Gnanaraja on the same project. Representation is usually carried out to apply for a retraction or to lower or lessen the charge brought against an accused.

The proceedings will resume on July 19 before Sessions Court judge Azura Alwi. Deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin confirmed the matter. Lim faces four charges of using his position as the then chief minister to solicit gratification to help Zarul's company secure the project. He was accused of receiving RM3.3 million for himself to assist the company owned by Zarul to carry out the tunnel project and main road works worth RM6,341,383,702 between January 2011 and August 2017.

Trio convicted of killing UiTM lecturer 2 decades ago get death penalty commuted to 38-years' jail,Dawn Chan,"July 12, 2024 @ 5:17pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Three men on death row escaped the noose after the Federal Court substituted the sentence with a 38-year jail term for killing Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) lecturer Bakarudin Busu 22 years ago. The trio were Azizul Azual Mohamad Jailani, 40, former sales executive Sulkarnain Alias, 46, and former forklift driver, Noorman Ab Wahab, 45. Bakarudin's semi-charred body was found in a drain in Subang Jaya. Evidence showed he was assaulted and slashed to death before he was burned. A three-panel judge led by Datuk Zabariah Mohd Yusof had on April 2, ordered the men to be caned 12 times. Zabariah, who sat with Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, made the unanimous decision to set aside the death penalty after allowing the sentence review. The 38-year imprisonment for Azizul Azual starts from the date of his arrest on Feb 17, 2002, while it is from Feb 16, 2002, for Sulkarnain and Noorman. The trio were sentenced to death by the Shah Alam High Court in 2009 for murdering Bakarudin, 35, at 9.30pm at SS19, Subang Jaya on Feb 12, 2002. During the review proceedings, deputy public prosecutor How May Ling objected to the application on the grounds that Bakarudin was brutally killed as the petrol used had left 70 per cent burns on his body before he was dumped in the drain. She said that the acts were pre-meditated when the three men brought along weapons with them when they met with Bakarudin earlier on the day of the incident. ""The victim was beaten up before he was stabbed and slashed with a sword which caused 13 wounds, including one that was 14 centimetres long on his head and had injured his brains,"" she said. Azizul Azual, the first applicant, had played a significant role as he was responsible for bringing the weapon to the scene, apart from being the first person to attack Bakarudin by kicking him until he fell. Sulkarnain, the second applicant, had arranged the meeting with Bakarudin with the help of his girlfriend. He had strangled Bakarudin, slashed him several times, burned him with petrol, took his wallet and tried to withdraw money via an automated teller machine. Noorman, the third applicant, had placed the sword on Bakarudin's neck and torched him with petrol. Lawyers Abdul Rashid Ismail who appeared for Azizah Azual and Datuk C. Vignesh Kumar for Sulkarnain and Noorman, asked the court to consider that the trio were young offenders. The lawyers asked the court to take into consideration that Bakarudin had earlier repeatedly harassed Sulkarnain's girlfriend, which prompted him to seek to resolve their spat ""man to man"" to stop the harassment. ""The murder was not planned but it happened because of provocative elements as the victim had harassed Sulkarnain's girlfriend without feeling guilty or apologising for his actions,"" he said. The incident occurred after Sulkarnain discovered that Bakarudin had called his girlfriend, who had been expelled from UiTM, asking her to spend a night at a condominium as a reward to help in her appeal to be readmitted to UiTM. On Feb 23, 2015, a five-member Federal Court panel led by Tan Sri Ahmad Maarop unanimously rejected the three men's final appeal and maintained their conviction and death sentence."

During today's proceedings, Deputy Public Prosecutor Hamizah Hisan suggested bail of RM15,000 with one surety for the accused.

Ramli said that despite the main suspect's death, investigations into the case would continue under Section 408 of the Penal Code. Meanwhile, police have welcomed suggestions by Deputy Finance Minister Lim Hui Ying that banking institutions should conduct detailed investigations into unauthorised banking transactions. ""There have been media reports where victims of account fraud claimed to have been taken by syndicate members to several banks to open accounts (mule accounts) without any verification by bank officers. ""There were also bank officers who colluded with syndicate members to facilitate the opening of dubious accounts by individuals claiming to be company owners, allowing fraudulent funds to be channelled into those company accounts,"" he said. Ramli added that under the new provisions, which will be enforced soon, police will also investigate and prosecute bank officers involved in syndicated fraud activities. Police have also suggested that banks strengthen their internal banking systems as a precaution to ensure the interests of customers are always safeguarded."

Trader retracts police report against Papagomo mid-trial,Dawn Chan,"July 12, 2024 @ 3:12pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A trader yesterday retracted his police report which had triggered investigations against controversial blogger Wan Muhammad Azri Wan Deris for alleged seditious remarks, just two hours after testifying on the first day of the trial. At the onset of the trial's second day at the Sessions Court today, defence lawyer Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali said Hisham Sharudin, 42, the first prosecution witness, made the decision to retract his initial police report. He said Hisham did so by lodging another police report about 2pm yesterday after giving his testimony against Wan Azri, better known as Papagomo, for his alleged seditious remarks that the government was pro-Israel and pro-West, before judge Siti Aminah Ghazali. ""As this has happened, I humbly submit, with the greatest respect to the prosecution, that we are going to go nowhere with this case. ""I ask the court's permission to use Section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to recall this witness for the just decision of this case.  ""At least we can mark the police report as an exhibit to confirm this matter. ""We do not want to be caught in a situation where we had threatened the witness or met him. This is because it says in the report that he was not forced by anyone to make the police report or blame any parties. ""The goal post has shifted from someone who had presented the narrative and now he himself does not want to continue this case. Otherwise, we are all going to waste our time,"" said Rafique. However, deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Mustaffa P. Kunyalam said the refusal of Hisham to continue with his police report against Wan Azri was not a factor to be considered by the court to halt the prosecution's case. ""The prosecution has 10 witnesses, including Hisham and another who had testified yesterday, to prove the case against the accused. ""Even if Hisham refuses to continue the case, it does not stop the prosecution from pursuing it against the accused. ""In this case, it is found that there were 'tactical manoeuvres' where Hisham had only wished to retract the report after giving his statement in court. ""If Hisham refuses to give his statement at the examination-in-chief, the prosecution has the right to use Section 357 of the CPC to force him to give a statement in court,"" he said. After hearing submissions, Siti Aminah allowed the defence's application to recall Hisham and ruled that the trial continue with the testimony of other witnesses. Meanwhile, the fifth prosecution Datuk Zahairi Baharim, a diplomatic officer with the Foreign Ministry, said Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had stated the Malaysian government was against violence, oppression and atrocities of the Israeli government against Palestinians in Gaza. He said based on Anwar's speeches in parliamentary hansards, it was clear that the government led by the prime minister is not pro-Israel. He said Anwar, who had attended ""Himpunan Malaysia Bersama Palestin"" in Axiata Arena, Bukit Jalil, had said Malaysia was in support of Palestine and condemns the cruelty of the Israeli regime on Palestinians in Gaza. The trial continues on July 29."

Sessions Court Judge Azrul Darus allowed Na'imah's application for the temporary release of her passport to enable her to meet her lawyer Dave Vasoodaven from Gulbenkian Andonian Solicitors and attend the La Biennale di Venezia in Venice between July 16 and July 20. This is her second application to travel overseas for an art exhibition, following her visit to the Basel Art Exhibition in Switzerland last month. Na'imah is the wife of former finance minister Tun Daim Zainuddin. The judge made the ruling after her lawyer, M. Puravalen, informed the court that his client wanted to obtain her passport from Sunday (July 13) until July 25. Deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Fadhly Mohd Zamry did not object to the application. The court also ordered Na'imah to return the document to the court within 48 hours of her return to the country on July 27. Na'imah in her supporting affidavit said she will attend the art exhibition in Venice in her capacity as Yayasan Ilham board of trustee's chairman. She said Yayasan Ilham is a non-profit foundation established to carry out philanthropic and charitable work, including promoting and exchanging art, culture, and education. ""The reason for choosing this period is solely because appointments have been set according to the availability of various individuals I will meet during my trip,"" she said. On March 22, High Court judge Datuk Ahmad Bache dismissed Na'imah's application to permanently regain her passport. Na'imah surrendered her passport at the Sessions Court as part of her bail condition when she was charged with failing to declare her assets to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). According to the charge sheet, Na'imah failed to comply with an MACC notice to declare her assets such as: *Companies — Ilham Tower Sdn Bhd and Ilham Baru Sdn Bhd;* Luxury vehicles — Mercedes Benz EQC400 and Mercedes Benz 500SL; *Properties — Menara Ilham, a residence in Bukit Tunku, four freehold pieces of land and buildings near Bukit Tunku as well as freehold land and a building near Jalan Anthinahapan and Cantoment Road in Penang. The offence falls under Section 36(2) of the MACC Act which carries a maximum five years' imprisonment and RM100,000 fine upon conviction. The 67-year-old was released on RM250,000 bail with one surety. A week later, her 85-year-old husband was also charged with a similar offence involving one bank account, seven luxury vehicles, 38 companies, and 25 properties at the MACC headquarters in Putrajaya on Dec 13, last year. Na'imah and her two sons, Amir and Amin, on Jan 10, were summoned to the MACC headquarters in Putrajaya to have their statements recorded. MACC had said this was done to ascertain the worth of some of the high-value assets in the country and abroad held under the companies belonging to the family in relation to the probe on Daim. The commission had said a notice was served to Daim under Section 36(1)(a) of the MACC Act 2009, on June 7 last year, while his family members were served notices under Section 36(1)(b) of the same act."
[UPDATED] PSI project gets green light as High Court dismisses fishermen's appeal,Audrey Dermawan,"July 11, 2024 @ 10:15am","GEORGE TOWN: The High Court here today dismissed the judicial review filed by seven fishermen to challenge the planning permission granted by the state Town and Country Planning director last August for the Penang South Island Project (PSI). The judicial review was filed alongside Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM) and Jaringan Ekologi dan Iklim (Jedi). With this ruling, the PSI project can now proceed as planned. The application for judicial review was initially filed by the seven fishermen, SAM, and Jedi at the Penang High Court in December last year. They sought to contest the planning permission issued by the state Town and Country Planning director. The nine applicants were suing the state Town and Country Planning (PLANMalaysia) director as the first respondent, the state Planning Committee (second respondent), the Penang government (third respondent), and SRS Consortium Sdn Bhd (fourth respondent). Quay also briefly dealt with the respective points. He said, firstly, regarding the legality of the Penang Structure Plan (PSP) 2030, the challenge was not against the legitimacy of the PSP 2030, but rather the planning permission in any event. He said that point was mooted because the PSP 2030 was presented on Oct 24 last year, and the evidence showed that the respondent had consulted and taken advice from the National Physical Planning Council (NPPC) and updated the plan accordingly before approving it and escalating it to the state executive council to consider the PSR master plan. ""That is not the subject matter of the challenge, but again, this point is mooted because the PSR master plan was approved on June 27, 2022, and it was submitted to the NPPC even though, according to the respondents, the submission was made voluntarily because there was no provision then under the TCPA which required submission. ""I am satisfied that it is incorrect for the applicant to contend that the NPPC should have given its advice on the PSR master plan and the draft PSP 2030 and was in breach of Section 20B of the TCPA. ""Next, concerning the non-compliance in relation to Section 22(2)(A) of the TCPA before the issuance of the planning permission, I accept the evidence of the respondents that there are two types of planning permission in question here. One is for reclamation, and the other is for top side development. I do not agree with the applicants that there was circumvention on the part of the respondent in splitting these two planning permissions. And the requirement of the law does not apply to the reclamation but only to the top side development,"" he added."

Judges Datuk Azmi Ariffin and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah joined Datuk Hadhariah in confirming the conviction and sentence previously determined by the Taiping High Court, Perak. Hendra Mulana, 33, admitted to having a forbidden relationship with a 12-year-old girl whom he knew through social media called 'Bigo' five years ago. Though they never met physically, Hendra often persuaded the victim to have explicit conversations to the point of exchanging pornographic pictures and videos through WhatsApp. The quorum concluded that Hendra's claim of being in a romantic relationship with the victim, with intentions to marry her, was not credible and noted that he made no effort to meet the girl's family to discuss his purported intentions. ""From the beginning, the appellant knew the victim was a child and only took advantage of her.

Judge cites proof of semen stains in ordering man to enter defence for rape,Alias Abd Rani,"July 10, 2024 @ 4:50pm","MUAR: The Sessions Court ordered a contractor to enter defence on three charges of raping his adopted daughter seven years ago. The accused, 46, was charged with three counts of raping the girl, who was 16 at the time, under Section 376(1) of the Penal Code. Judge Abu Bakar Manat said the prosecution proved a prima facie case against the accused and this was supported by evidence in the form of semen stains on a mattress and screenshots of conversations between the victim and the accused. ""Therefore, after a maximum evaluation as well as witnesses' evidence and documentary exhibits presented throughout the trial, the court orders the accused to enter defence,"" Abu Bakar said. Ten prosecution witnesses testified in the trial which began in 2018. According to the first charge, the accused allegedly raped the girl in a room of a house in the district between 2am and 4am in January 2017. For the second and third charges, he was accused of committing the acts on the girl in July and December 2017 at the same time and place.

Deputy public prosecutor Danial Munir prosecuted while the accused was represented by lawyer Munirah Najihah Shaari. The court set Aug 21, Sept 3 and 4 for the accused to enter defence."
"Family denied leave to appeal dismissal of second lawsuit against police, Govt",Bernama,"July 10, 2024 @ 4:48pm","PUTRAJAYA: The family of detainee P. Karuna Nithi, who died in police custody 11 years ago, were denied leave by the Federal Court today to appeal against the Court of Appeal's dismissal of their second lawsuit against the government and police. A three-judge panel led by Judge Datuk Nallini Pathmanathan denied the application of Karuna Nithi's widow, R. Kaliamah, and her two sons, K. Yugesh Varan and K. Kisho Kumar, for leave to appeal in their second lawsuit. The other presiding judges were Justices Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera. Judge Nallini said that the issue in their second suit is res judicata, meaning it has been adjudicated by a competent court and therefore cannot be pursued further by the same parties. ""Regrettably, we will have to dismiss the application for leave to appeal with no order as to costs,"" she said via Zoom proceedings. She explained that the second suit is based on the same facts, same parties, and same issues, except for the introduction of a new point of law. This, she noted, is a classic definition of res judicata, adding that the law is clear, and the court is bound to follow it. ""It is a very sad thing that this gentleman, who was in custody, suffered 49 blows. But the court has gone through the process and our hands are tied,"" said Justice Nallini. She added that issues relating to Article 5 of the Federal Constitution on a person's fundamental liberty, have been argued. Judge Nallini said since the law is very clear, the court did not need to hear submissions from senior federal counsel Donald Joseph Franklin who appeared for the 16 respondents including the policemen, the Home Minister, and the government. Earlier, lawyer T. Manoharan who represented Kaliamah and her sons said their first suit was filed under Section 7 of the Civil Law Act 1956 but the second suit is under public law. Karuna Nithi was arrested on May 28, 2013, but died in custody on June 1, 2013, and was found with 49 fresh injuries on his body. In January 2015, the coroner's open verdict ruled that Karuna Nithi's death was due to several factors, including beatings by the police and other inmates, resulting in the injuries he sustained. Following the inquest, Kaliamah and her sons filed a lawsuit on Jan 25, 2018, at the Seremban High Court, alleging negligence and assault by the police and government leading to Karuna Nithi's death. However, the court dismissed the family's suit, stating it was filed out of time, as it was lodged more than three years after Karuna Nithi died in custody in 2013. The Court of Appeal and Federal Court also upheld the decision. Kaliamah and her two sons then filed another lawsuit on Jan 26, 2021, against 16 defendants including 14 policemen, the Home Minister, and the government seeking compensation for Karuna Nithi's death. In February 2022, the Kuala Lumpur High Court dismissed the family's second suit and on Oct 19, 2023, the appellate court upheld that decision. — BERNAMA"

Licensed gaming companies celebrate High Court's overturn of Kedah govt's ban,Adie Zulkifli,"July 10, 2024 @ 4:15pm","ALOR STAR: Licensed gaming companies have praised the High Court's decision to overturn the Kedah state government's ban on their operations, in effect since early last year. In a joint statement, STM Lottery Sdn Bhd (STM Lottery) and Magnum Corporation Sdn Bhd (Magnum) called the Alor Star High Court's June 20 ruling ""a significant ruling that affects our businesses and our community."" STM Lottery's assistant general manager (North) Yip Kok Chyuan said that the court found the Kedah government's ban on renewing business licence for pool betting to be inconsistent with the Federal Constitution. ""Simply put, the local authorities do not have the power to ban licensed pool betting under their business premises licence. This would create a conflict between the state and the federal laws. ""This ruling is crucial for the licensed Number Forecast Operators (NFO). It reinforces the importance of the Federal Constitution and confirms that the state's executive authority cannot exceed legislation power,"" he said in a press conference here today. Magnum's regional head, Suy Kok Yik, echoed this sentiment, saying that the ruling provided ""immense relief and renewed hope"" for agents who faced financial hardships due to the business disruptions. ""For over 17 months, our agents have struggled financially. This decision allows them to rebuild and continue their work with greater stability,"" Suy said. The state government's move had impacted 45 agents under Sports Toto, Magnum, and Da Ma Chai, affecting over 100 employees. Following the court decision, Yip urged the state government to cooperate in renewing the business licences. ""We hope the state government will now work with us to renew the licence for licensed pool betting, allowing our agents to resume their livelihoods,"" he said. Despite the High Court ruling, Yip acknowledged the interim stay pending the state government's appeal to the Court of Appeal. ""We will assist our agents to resolve all legal requirements for them to recommence their business. ""As for the reopening (of outlets) wise, we will follow the lawyer's advice on when to reopen them,"" he said. Yesterday, Kedah Pas commissioner Datuk Ahmad Yahaya defended the state government's decision, saying that it was within their power to shut down licensed gaming outlets. The Pokok Sena member of Parliament was reported as saying the closure was done in accordance with the state government's power through the local government, at each district level. During the Kedah state assembly sitting on Nov 14, 2021, Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor announced that Kedah would no longer approve new licensed gaming outlets nor renew existing licences. Following the decision, all licensed gaming outlets in Kedah were fully ceased by Jan 1 last year. (hyperlink: https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2024/07/1074367/kedah-pas-defends-dec...)"

Deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Mustafa P Kunyalam confirmed that the AGC rejected Isham's representation letter, received on March 25. This means Isham's committal proceedings will go to full trial, which is expected to commence before High Court judge Datuk Noorin Badaruddin on Oct 14. Isham submitted the representation letter to make an open and unconditional apology to the Judiciary regarding the statement he made. In the ex-parte application filed Dec 28, last year, the Attorney-General also requested the court to imprison or impose a fine on Isham for the offence. It was over an interview titled ""Townhall for Justice: Keadilan Sebenarnya Untuk Siapa"", during which Isham reportedly commented on the trial and appeal of Najib in the SRC International and 1MDB cases. The comments were published on the Facebook page of ""The Malaya Post"" on Sept 30 last year. On April 23, Isham issued an unconditional apology after claiming that the AGC had suggested he filed a representation letter for an unconditional apology. He said he agreed to the suggestion due to the high legal costs and he wanted to focus on another legal battle with Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's former aide Farhash Wafa Salvador Rizal Mubarak involving the Heitech Padu fiasco. ""The representation was made after it was suggested by the AGC to my lawyer a few weeks ago. Perhaps the AGC does not want to prolong this case in open court. ""Therefore, I agreed with their (AGC's) suggestion because legal costs are quite high, and I am not a wealthy person or a billionaire,"" he said in a statement."

"Woman duped of RM126,490 in online job scam",Jassmine Shadiqe,"July 9, 2024 @ 10:17pm","SERI ALAM: Desperate for a job, a 44-year-old woman was cheated out of RM126,490, including money borrowed from her relatives, after falling prey to an online job scam. The nightmare of the woman, who was recently laid off from a printing factory, began when she became acquainted online with a cyber-friend who offered her a part-time job with lucrative returns in May this year. The part-time job opportunity involved selling hotel accommodation packages, offering lucrative commissions based on the packages sold. She was promised a 15 percent commission for five-star hotel packages and 10 percent for lower-rated packages. District police chief Superintendent Mohd Sohaimi Ishak said the woman was given a link to register as an agent and was instructed to make upfront payments as her capital. ""Attracted by the promised commissions and the non-taxing nature of the job, which allowed her time to attend to other daily errands, she signed up for the offer. ""She transferred an undisclosed sum to the given bank account and sold several hotel packages, earning over 100 percent in commissions. ""Between May 17 and 28, she made 17 online cash transfers to six different bank accounts, totaling RM126,490,"" he said. It is learned that the victim also borrowed money from her relatives to increase her investments. ""The woman, however, realised she had been duped when she could not withdraw her commissions and was instead asked by the scammer to make additional payments."" She lodged a police report on Friday (July 5), after all attempts to contact her cyber-friend proved futile. The case, Sohaimi said, is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. He added that the police will also probe the involvement of 'money mules' bank accounts. He advised the public to exercise caution and not to trust any online investment or job offers promising easy methods and high commissions."

Their activities came to light in April this year, and several arrests were made in a series of raids on June 13 and 19. Three Malaysians, including a woman, were arrested, while two disabled foreign men, were rescued. Johor police chief, Commissioner M. Kumar, said the syndicate's modus operandi was to travel overseas, identify the disabled individuals, and recruit them as beggars. The victims were brought into the country legally on tourist visas before being assigned to a transporter-cum-caretaker in various states in the country. The foreigners were given lodging and housing. However, they were required to get between RM250 and RM300 a day, and work six hours daily – rain or shine. They had to pay RM800 a week to their caretaker as a fee for their passport arrangements, and RM10 daily for him to ferry them between their landed rented premises, and their ""workplace"". Their daily collection was handed over to the caretaker, and they were paid RM300 a month. The foreigners were equipped with Wi-Fi speakers, microphones, and a donation box, and would sing to tug at the heartstrings of passers-by at various locations, namely night markets, food courts, and event spaces. Kumar said the caretaker would wait in a parked vehicle, where he would be within eyeshot of the beggars, to ensure that they did not flee. One of the two was in a wheelchair, while the other had deformed legs, and needed crutches to move around. ""Police investigations revealed that the beggars could earn between RM2,000 and RM3,000 a week, raking up to RM8,000 a month. ""The syndicate made Malaysia and its people the prime target for its operations because of the lucrative earnings. It exploited the people's compassionate nature, since Malaysians would help those in need,"" he told a press conference at the state police contingent headquarters here, today. He added that a man and a woman, aged 42 and 52, were arrested in a series of raids between 8.30pm and 10.30pm in the state's capital, on June 13. They are believed to have been recruited as caretakers by the syndicate, responsible for ferrying the foreign beggars to several locations to peddle the streets. Two disabled foreign men, aged 44 and 55, were also rescued. In a follow-up operation on June 19, police raided an apartment in the city centre at 11.45pm and arrested a 42-year-old man. He too, was allegedly a caretaker to one of the two rescued foreigners. Police seized three mobile phones, cars, keys, a speaker, microphones, and RM1,859 during the raids. The suspects are being investigated under Section 14 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007. The offence is punishable with life in prison, or a five-year jail term, and whipping. Kumar said the foreigners are now under a 21-day protection order. Their embassy has been notified."

Sources said this was among the matters that will be looked into after Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission officers collected documents at the Human Resources Ministry and HRD Corp, which is under the purview of the ministry, today (July 9). ""The MACC will examine the extent to which the investment is legal and whether it is allowed.

Appeals Court affirms CTOS's authority to formulate credit scores,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"July 9, 2024 @ 5:51pm","PUTRAJAYA: CTOS Data Systems Sdn Bhd (CTOS) has succeeded in its appeal to overrule the High Court ruling that stated it does not have the power to formulate its own credit score. Lawyer Ashok Kandiah who represented the company together with Datuk Malik Imtiaz Sarwar and Celline Teh confirmed this when contacted today. He said a three-member bench led by Judge Datuk Lee Swee Seng made the decision after allowing the company's appeal against a High Court decision in March. Other members of the bench were Datuk Azimah Omar and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. Ashok said agencies such as CTOS are authorised to formulate and publish credit scores as part of their credit reporting business under the Credit Reporting Agencies Act (CRAA) 2010. He said the appellate court also had set aside the lower court's order requiring the company to pay RM200,000 to a businesswoman Suriati Mohd Yusoff over an inaccurate credit rating. ""The plaintiff (Suriati) failed to make out a case in defamation, negligence or breach of statutory duty against CTOS. ""The court also ruled that the company does not owe any duty of care in common law to Suriati,"" he said. The court also awarded RM65,000 in costs to be paid by the plaintiff Suriati. On March 11, High Court judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir ruled that CTOS does not have the power to formulate its own credit score as it was only empowered to be a repository of the credit information to which its subscribers have access. ""CTOS's main role is to collect, record, hold and store the information received. ""The company is also empowered to disseminate the information to its subscribers, and this includes financial institutions. ""By formulating a credit score, CTOS has gone beyond its statutory functions,"" he said. Akhtar said this in his judgment before ordering CTOS to pay RM200,000 in general damages to Suriati, who owned a resort in Pulau Perhentian, for inaccurate credit rating. The 43-year-old businesswoman sued CTOS for alleged negligence and breach of fiduciary duty in misrepresenting her credit rating leading to a loss of reputation, personal losses as well as business losses. Apart from inaccurate information, she contended that the defendant had given her a low credit score leading to loss of confidence from financial institutions."

""He offered me an all-expense paid trip to Bangkok in May to attend a religious ritual and for a holiday,"" said Law. ""In Thailand, he brought me to a car and gave me a bottle of water to drink.

He later learnt that he was taken to Mae Sot in Myanmar. ""There were another Malaysian and four Chinese nationals held hostage with me. We were asked (by our captors) if we wanted to go back to our home countries.

""I want to remind everyone (Malaysians) not to easily trust anyone, even close friends because anyone can be deceived. Only family can truly be trusted,"" she said, adding that she was grateful that her husband was brought home safely."

"1MDB bound by previous court's ruling that seized luxury goods are legal, says Rosmah",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"July 5, 2024 @ 1:57pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor claimed today that the High Court had already ruled that luxury goods worth US$346 million seized from her residence were not proceeds of unlawful activity. The wife of the incarcerated former prime minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak, argued that 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) was bound by a 2022 court ruling that found no proof linking the items seized during a police raid on an apartment in the Pavilion Residences to the company. The raid on the apartment owned by OBYU Holdings on May 17, 2018, came soon after the 14th General Election, which saw a Najib-led Barisan Nasional losing federal power. Rosmah made this contention in her defence statement in 1MDB's lawsuit against her and Singaporean designer Shabnam Naraindas Daswani also known as Natasha Mirpuri. The company claimed that a total of 320 payments totalling US$346,010,498 were made to 48 different vendors in 14 countries between 2010 and 2014. Rosmah contended that the entirety of this action was barred by the legal principle of res judicata, which prevents the same parties from re-litigating the same issue in court. ""The plaintiffs in this action have completely failed to specify what luxury items were allegedly requested and received by the first defendant (Rosmah). ""The plaintiffs are attempting to 'fish for evidence' after initiating this action against Rosmah, which is contrary to established legal principles,"" she claimed. On Nov 14, 2022, High Court judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin dismissed the government's application to forfeit RM80 million in luxury items owned by Najib and Rosmah. The luxury items in question include 2,435 pieces of jewellery, seven Richard Mille watches and 29 handbags, which were seized from a condominium unit owned by OBYU Holdings on May 17, 2018. On Nov 30 of the same year, former attorney-general Tan Sri Idrus Harun said that the government had decided not to appeal against Jamil's decision. In the present suit, 1MDB claimed that the defendants had used the funds to purchase luxury items such as jewellery, watches and handbags. The company claimed its funds, which were to be utilised for investments in various ventures, were instead wrongfully or fraudulently transferred out to entities registered in offshore jurisdictions which had no connection with or served no legitimate purpose about the purported investment objectives. The company asserted that the funds were routed through numerous offshore entities and bank accounts controlled by individuals, including Najib and his associates. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order to compel Rosmah to pay US$346,010,489 or such other sum as to be assessed by the court. They are also seeking damages or fair compensation to be determined by the court. On May 10, 2022, 1MDB filed 22 civil suits against various parties, including Najib to recover RM96.6 billion in assets. The Finance Ministry in a statement said six of the 22 writs were filed by 1MDB, while the remaining 16 were filed by its former subsidiary SRC International Sdn Bhd. The civil suits were filed as an effort by both entities to recover their assets with a combined total of over RM96.6 billion including approximately RM300 million against various local parties. The writs filed by 1MDB are against nine entities - including two foreign financial institutions, and 25 individuals."

Liau Hai Keong, 55, pleaded guilty after the charge was read out by the court interpreter in front of magistrate Wahidah Zainal Abidin. The father-of-four was charged with cutting down a tree with a diameter of more than 0.8m within the jurisdiction of the Kuantan City Council without receiving any written consent from the council. He had allegedly committed the offence at Bandar Indera Mahkota here about 11am on April 21.

The city council's prosecuting officer Mohammad Nur Hafiz Ramlan appeared for prosecution, while Liau was represented by Mohd Shuhairi Ziqrul Sapi. In mitigation, Shuhairi pleaded for a minimum fine, saying that his client had to support his wife and four children with his RM2,000 monthly income. ""The accused has repented and will be careful with his actions in the future. My client has already paid a compound and the civil charges initiated by the Kuantan City Council for his action."" Nur Hafiz told the court that the Batai Laut tree, or scientifically known as Peltophorum pterocarpum, which is more than half a century old, was protected, and placed under the city council's care. He said the city council spent a huge cost to maintain the heritage tree to ensure it does not decay and the move to cut the tree located along the main road had resulted in an eyesore to passersby. Wahidah ordered Liau to pay a RM4,000 fine, in default of two months in jail. He paid the fine. According to the facts of the case, Liau had given instruction to some individuals to cut the tree, which was blocking his business premises. A video of the tree-cutting incident was shared on Facebook prompting the Kuantan City Council to initiate action. Caption: Trader Liau Hai Keong outside the Kuantan magistrate's court today."

Najib on house arrest review dismissal: 'Sad news this morning',Mohamad Al As,"July 3, 2024 @ 3:18pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Najib Razak took to Facebook today to express sadness at the High Court's dismissal of his application for a judicial review on a purported addendum allowing him to serve his jail sentence under house arrest. ""Sad news this morning. The High Court judge said he found no evidence that the King's addendum order exists because the affidavits by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri (Dr Ahmad) Zahid Hamidi and Pahang Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy (Wan Ismail) and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's speech were merely hearsay."" The former prime minister retorted that the federal government, the Attorney-General's Chambers and the Pahang palace had never denied that the order existed. Najib's post followed the decision of High Court judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh to dismiss Najib's application for a judicial review. Amarjeet, when dismissing the legal bid, said all affidavits filed to support Najib's case, including those by Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and vice-president Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail, were hearsay.  The deputy prime minister had claimed the document was shown to him by former Selangor Umno treasurer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz at his house near Country Heights on Jan 30. Zahid's contention was supported by Wan Rosdy when the Pahang menteri besar in his supporting affidavit also said Tengku Zafrul had told him of the document's existence dated Jan 29. However, the judge, in his ruling, said Zahid's statements were purely hearsay as his belief and source of information were based solely on what he heard from Tengku Zafrul, with no direct knowledge of the addendum order. Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah said earlier Najib had instructed him to file an appeal on the High Court ruling. In April, Najib filed a judicial review to establish the existence of the addendum order dated January 29, issued by the former Yang di-Pertuan Agong, which he claims the government has kept silent about. He named the home minister, Prison Department commissioner general, attorney-general (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, minister in the prime minister's department (law and institutional reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents.

Authorities raid shop which sold cooking gas cylinders without a licence for 22 years,Ramyeeajanani,"July 3, 2024 @ 2:03pm","SEBERANG PRAI: Officers from the Penang Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Ministry raided a premises here, which is believed to have been used as a hub to sell liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) without a licence for the past 22 years. A total of 11 LPG cylinders worth more than RM1,100 were seized. According to Buletin TV3, surveillance by enforcement officers found that despite previous raids by authorities, some people have continued to sell the controlled product from the location, as well as obtaining supplies from unlicensed suppliers. The operation was led by enforcement officer Mohd Naim Jan, who was assisted by two policemen and five other members of the KPDN Enforcement Division. ""The trader's justification was completely illogical when he claimed ignorance of the requirements for a sales licence to sell LPG.   ""He then later claimed to have applied for a licence and was awaiting permission from the authorities,"" he said. Naim added that besides selling LPG without a licence, the trader was also suspected of selling the LPG for more than the fixed price of RM26.60 per 14kg cylinder. The LPG gas sold was suspected to be obtained from unregistered suppliers because the trader had failed to provide official receipts for his purchases. The enforcement officers had also summoned the owner of the property in question to appear at the ministry's headquarters for further action. The premises owner is also liable to proceedings under the Control of Supplies Act 1961, with a fine of up to RM1 million in fine, three years imprisonment, or both upon conviction."

"'It is all pure hearsay,' says judge over Najib's legal bid for house arrest",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"July 3, 2024 @ 1:21pm","KUALA LUMPUR: All affidavits pertaining to Datuk Seri Najib Razak's judicial review to determine the existence of an addendum order by the former King, which allegedly granted him house arrest, were hearsay, the High Court ruled today. Judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh said all affidavits in Najib's case contained bare statements without mentioning the source and his belief of the existence of the addendum order. An affidavit is a written, sworn statement of truth used as evidence in court or other legal proceedings. The former prime minister had filed two affidavits to support his case while another the remaining two were from Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and his vice-president Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail. Zahid in his affidavit, confirmed the existence of an addendum order from the former Yang di-Pertuan Agong allowing his former boss to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.  The deputy prime minister claimed the document was shown to him by former Selangor Umno treasurer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz at his house near Country Heights on Jan 30. Zahid's contention was supported by Wan Rosdy when the Pahang Menteri Besar in his supporting affidavit also said Tengku Zafrul had told him of the document's existence dated Jan 29. However, the judge, in his ruling, said Zahid's statements were purely hearsay as his belief and source of information were based solely on what he heard from Tengku Zafrul, with no direct knowledge of the addendum order. ""The applicant relied on the source, Tengku Zafrul, but the source did not affirm any affidavit. There is also no explanation forthcoming as to this act. ""The source was available but not used. ""Tengku Zafrul had attempted to file an affidavit but this court denied him as the law does not allow him to do so at the leave (permission) stage,"" he said. He said as a result, there was no affidavit verifying the material facts stated by Najib in his application. ""As such, there can be no arguable case for further investigation at the substantive stage."" Amarjeet also stated that no written law or provision in the Federal Constitution imposes a legal duty on the Pardons Board to confirm the existence of, or produce, any order related to the exercise of the power of pardon. The court also did not issue any order for costs. Najib was represented by his lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah while Senior Federal Counsels Shamsul Bolhassan and Ahmad Hanir Hambaly appeared for the government. In April, Najib filed a judicial review to establish the existence of the addendum order dated Jan 29, issued by former Yang di-Pertuan Agong which he claimed the government had kept silent. He named the Home Minister, Prison Department commissioner general, Attorney-General (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents. Najib claimed that his lawyers have requested an original copy or a copy of the order from the Kajang Prison but have not received a response. He also claimed the subsequent inaction by the Home Minister and Prison Department commissioner general to execute the said order, is irrational, unreasonable, illegal, and arbitrary and offends the Federal Constitution and laws. On Jan 29, the Federal Territories Pardons Board, which the then King presided over, halved Najib's 12-year jail sentence for abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in the SRC International case and reduced his RM210 million fine to RM50 million."

Judge Rozina Ayob approved the request after the prosecution represented by Nor Asma Ahmad and Zander Lim did not object to the application of the 77-year-old Pagoh member of parliament to get his passport from today until Aug 20. Rozina ordered the passport to be handed over to Muhyiddin, whose registered name is Mahiaddin Md Yasin, today and returned to the court on Aug 20. Asked by Rozina why the passport was needed early, Muhyiddin's lawyer, Datuk Seri K. Kumaraendran said it was for his client to obtain clearance from the Immigration Department. Muhyiddin, in his affidavit-in-support for the application filed on June 26, stated that he and his wife will fly to London on the night of July 19 and are expected to return here on Aug 16. The Bersatu president said he and his wife will be attending the graduation ceremony on July 23 at the Royal Festival Hall in Southbank Centre, London.

""This ceremony is an important occasion for my granddaughter and her family members. ""I want to attend her graduation because it is once in a lifetime and I want to witness and recognise her success. ""She had also expressed wishes for my wife and I to attend the graduation and to bear witness to her achievements. ""The tickets to attend the graduation have been purchased for me and my other family members,"" he said.

On March 10 last year, Muhyiddin was charged with four counts of using his powers as the then prime minister and Bersatu president to obtain bribes amounting to RM232.5 million from three companies, namely Bukhary Equity Sdn Bhd, Nepturis Sdn Bhd and Mamfor Sdn Bhd as well as Datuk Azman Yusoff for the party. He had allegedly committed the offences at the prime minister's office, Bangunan Perdana Putra, Federal Government Administration Centre in Putrajaya between March 1, 2020 and Aug 20, 2021. He was also charged at the Shah Alam Sessions Court on March 13 last year with receiving proceeds from unlawful activities amounting to RM5 million, and the case had been transferred to the Sessions Court here for a joint trial. On Aug 15 last year, the High Court acquitted and discharged Muhyiddin of four counts of abuse of power involving RM232.5 million in connection with the Jana Wibawa project. Following the development, Muhyiddin filed an application to strike out his remaining three money laundering charges linked to the Jana Wibawa scandal. He also wanted the Sessions Court to grant him a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) from the charges. The prosecution then filed a notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal against the decision, and the court has set Feb 28 and 29 for the hearing. On Nov 29 last year, the same court dismissed Muhyiddin's application for permanently retrieving his passport."
Fuel smugglers at Kelantan-Thai border modify tanks to fill up to 200 litres,Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"July 3, 2024 @ 12:32pm","TUMPAT: Diesel smugglers operating along the border have modified the fuel tanks of their cars to be able to hold up to 200 litres of fuel. Pengkalan Kubor Region 3 Marine Police Force commanding officer Assistant Superintendent Akil Abdul Rauf said they had discovered this in series of operations, with the latest case on Thursday. In the operation in Simpangan, he said more than 400 litres of petrol were seized from two Proton Wiras which had modified their tanks. ""We suspect the smugglers were about to smuggle the fuel out to the neighbouring country when they were seized,"" he said. He said smugglers modified their vehicles to enable them to fill as much fuel as they can before sending them via the many illegal jetties along the Golok river. ""They will normally use containers of various sizes to store the fuel, and later into tanks before placing the tanks inside the car's boot. ""They will then use a rubber pipe to channel the fuel from the petrol station pump into the container. ""Our operations also showed that of late, smugglers have turned to RON95 rather than diesel,"" he added. He said the Pengkalan Kubor marine police have recorded 93 cases of RON95 smuggling with the seizure of 21,020 litres worth RM39,678. The cases were recorded from January to June, he said. During the period, they also recorded 14 cases of diesel smuggling with the seizure of more than 45,000 litres worth RM97,000. On June 7, Domestic Trade and Cost of Living Minister Datuk Armizan Mohd Ali said smuggling of RON95 to Thailand has grown since April as the fuel is retailing there at three times the price in Malaysia. He said the rationalisation of the diesel subsidy in Malaysia is also making smugglers switch focus to RON95, as the smugglers realised they could make a bigger profit from the sale of RON95 in Thailand. The upsurge in the activity has been detected in Kelantan and Kedah."

Najib fails to initiate judicial review over house arrest,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"July 3, 2024 @ 9:48am","KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Najib Razak has failed to initiate a judicial review over the addendum order by the former King allowing him to serve the remainder of his jail sentence under house arrest. High Court judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh today dismissed the former prime minister's leave application for the court to hear the case. The judge said all affidavits filed to support Najib's case including by Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and vice-president Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail were hearsay. In April, he filed a judicial review to establish the existence of the addendum order dated Jan 29, issued by former Yang di-Pertuan Agong which he claimed the government has kept silent about. On Jan 29, the Federal Territories Pardons Board, which the then King presided over, halved Najib's 12-year jail sentence for abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in the SRC International case and reduced his RM210 million fine to RM50 million.

""Taking into account the fact that the plastic bag was held and placed by the accused himself into the bonnet, then it is clear that it can link the accused directly to the case item which is the drugs found in the plastic bag. ""Therefore, the prosecution succeeded in proving a prima facie case and the accused was ordered to defend himself,"" he said. As for the second accused, the judge said she was there to fetch and send her husband by car. ""Therefore she is acquitted and discharged without her defence being called,"" he added.

Federal Court maintains ex-barber's death sentence for killing baby,,No published date found," The post-mortem examination results of the victim revealed she had suffered severe vaginal injuries that doctors had to stitch to stop the bleeding, apart from sexual, anal and brain injuries. At that time, Baby Zara had only weighed 8.26kg and none of her teeth had grown yet. A three-judge panel made the unanimous decision to reject 42-year-old Hazmi Majid's final appeal against the conviction and sentence. Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, who sat with Datuk Abu Bakar Jais and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, found that the conviction and death sentence of the Shah Alam High Court on Aug 20,2021 and affirmed by the Court of Appeal on March 1 last year, was safe as the crime was heinous.  Hazmi was charged with the murder of Baby Zara between 10.30am and 1.30pm at an apartment unit in Bandar Baru Bangi on Nov 7, 2018. Defence lawyer T. Vijayandran, who stood for Hazmi as the appellant, said his client was not aware of his actions as he was under the influence of drugs. He had asked for a jail term of 30 to 35 years if the court decided to set aside the death sentence. However, deputy public prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi said Hazmi's appeal must be rejected. She said claims that he was under the influence of drugs cannot be accepted as his actions in disposing of evidence by washing a towel to get rid of blood showed he was aware of his moves. Tetralina described the case as the ""rarest of the rare"" and warranted the death sentence being upheld. ""The victim was sent to the babysitter's home at 6.45am on the day of the incident but she was in a critical condition, with serious injuries to her head at 1.30pm,"" she said. She added that Hazmi had never helped his wife with babysitting duties but on that day, he had offered to bathe Baby Zara. On Nov 23,2018, Hazmi was charged at the Kajang magistrate's court with the murder of Baby Zara. On Nov 28, 2018, the Kajang Sessions Court sentenced him to 20 years' jail and 12 strokes of the rotan after he pleaded guilty to two counts of inserting his finger into the baby's private parts. For each count, Hazmi was sentenced to 20 years jail and six strokes of the rotan, but the court ordered for the sentence to run concurrently from the date of arrest on Nov 13. The then Tengku Mahkota Johor, who is now Regent of Johor, His Highness Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim and his wife, Her Highness Che' Puan Mahkota Khaleeda Bustamam, had expressed grief over the baby's death, describing it as heartbreaking and emotionally disturbing."

"Johor Immigration officers cripple human trafficking, fake refugee card syndicate",Jassmine Shadiqe,No published date found,"   The syndicate used ""rat lanes"", or ungazetted routes, by sea to smuggle in the Myanmar nationals. Their main target was the Arakan ethnic minority, with victims charged a RM3,000 fee each to enter the country. For an additional RM100, they will be transported by land to a transit house located in an oil palm plantation in Mersing to ""acclimatise"". State Immigration director Datuk Mohd Rusdi Mohd Darus said the department's enforcement officers mounted a four-hour surveillance on workers' quarters in the oil palm plantation in Mersing before storming in at 2.20am today. Five undocumented Indonesian men aged between 21 and 49 attempted to flee, with some hiding under beds, but were rounded up and detained by the 26 immigration enforcement officers deployed to the scene. The Indonesians, said Rusdi, are believed to be part of the syndicate's members who watched over the Myanmar nationals housed there. Rusdi said today's operation was a follow-up to one on Thursday in Kluang. Acting on a two-day surveillance mounted on a double-storey shop-house in Kluang, the enforcement officers stormed into the premises where eight Myanmar nationals were being kept. They detained four men and a woman aged between 26 and 47, all of whom are believed to be members of the same syndicate, including the agent who acted as their leader. There were also three Arakan ethnic men aged between 35 and 49, who had been smuggled into the country some 14 days earlier. ""The Myanmar nationals claimed that they had been locked in the unit since their arrival, and were not allowed to leave the premise, until their future employers arrived,"" said Rusdi. He added that the raiding party found two Myanmar passports, 12 Arakan Refugee Relief Committee cards which are believed to be fake, printed UNHCR letterhead forms, and RM15,855. The syndicate's agent with legal documents to remain in the country is believed to have been behind the illicit operations for at least six years. Rusdi said given his targeted victims were Arakanese, which was hardly heard of in Johor, he managed to keep his illegal operations under the radar and away from the enforcement authorities. Investigations are underway to determine the Arakan refugee card authenticity, while the undocumented foreigners were detained under Section 6(1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 for remaining in the country without valid permits and documents. The syndicate agent was detained under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act."

[UPDATED] Umno's Lokman spared a month's jail for intimidating 1MDB witness,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"July 1, 2024 @ 1:33pm","PUTRAJAYA: Umno Supreme Council member Datuk Lokman Noor Adam was spared a prison sentence for a contempt of court charge of intimidating a witness in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) trial, after the Federal Court commuted it to a good behaviour bond. In 2021, Lokman was sentenced to a month in jail after he was convicted of intimidating and threatening one of the key witnesses in the trial of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak involving the misappropriation of RM2.28 billion of 1MDB funds. In today's (July 1) proceeding, a three-panel apex court judge led by Tan Sri Nallini Pathmanathan made the unanimous decision as Lokman had issued his unreserved apology to the court before a ruling was made. ""The appellant (Lokman) has tendered a full and unreserved apology, which fully indicates his remorse and repentance. ""He has gone on to undertake not to repeat such behaviour again.  ""Having considered the remorse expressed by the appellant and coupled with the broad and extensive undertaking he has given not to repeat such behaviour again in the body of the apology, we are of the view that the sentence of imprisonment may not be the most appropriate punishment to mete out. ""We have also given consideration to the fact that the issuance of an apology in itself does not exonerate a contemnor in every case. ""However, it does have an impact on the sentence to be imposed,"" she said. The other judges who presided were Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. Nallini said that intimidating witnesses, whether before or after they give evidence, undermined the administration of justice. ""This is because justice cannot be administered if witnesses do not come forward to testify. ""If they are scared to do so, then the wheels of the courts and the justice system would be adversely affected."" The committal proceeding was instituted against Lokman by former attorney-general Tan Sri Tommy Thomas. In the application to initiate the committal proceedings, Tommy alleged that Lokman had been in contempt of court on two occasions on Sept 25, 2019. Tommy had sought an order that Lokman be committed to prison or fined for contempt. Lokman had in a video interview uttered words implying a threat against Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin for having given evidence against Najib in the trial. Amhari was the former special officer to Najib."

"Lecturer sacked for awarding grades to students who missed exams, court upholds dismissal",New Straits Times,"June 30, 2024 @ 10:00am","KUALA LUMPUR: The industrial court upheld the dismissal of a Tati University College lecturer for awarding grades to three absent students and failing to grade three others who were present at their final exams. The court found the 53-year-old lecturer guilty on all four charges brought by the state-owned institution, including wrongly marking scripts and awarding grades without proper evaluation, FMT reported. In the judgment dated June 20, Industrial court chairman D Paramalingam said that the lecturer's ""misdeeds cannot be viewed lightly"". He emphasised the severity of the lecturer's actions, noting the potential impact on students' futures and the institution's reputation. ""Her actions are very serious because they can affect the future of the students, some of whom depend on scholarships, loans from the National Higher Education Fund and the public services department,"" Paramalingam said. The lecturer, who had been employed since 2014 on short-term contracts, was terminated after a domestic inquiry in 2020 confirmed her misconduct. Despite her defence of excessive workload and a faulty grading system, the court dismissed her claims due to lack of evidence. The inquiry found her guilty of awarding incorrect grades and not properly marking examination scripts. Specifically, she was charged with: -Awarding B grades to two students and a B+ to another in the Malaysian Studies paper despite their absence from the exam. -Failing to grade three students who attended the same exam. -Preparing incorrect answer scripts. -Awarding grades without properly marking the scripts. During the trial, a college official testified that the grading errors had been rectified, and the correct grades were subsequently awarded. The case also involved issues with group work grading and unmarked scripts for which grades were assigned. The court highlighted that such misconduct could damage the institution's reputation, especially during certification audits. Previous issues with the lecturer included placing wrong cover pages on exam papers and inappropriate social media interactions. Following her termination, the lecturer claimed wrongful dismissal but the court upheld the university's decision, stressing that her actions undermined her integrity as a lecturer."

"Police used all available resources to locate Indira's husband, says judicial commissioner",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 28, 2024 @ 5:50pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court today dismissed a RM100 million suit by kindergarten teacher M. Indira Gandhi against the inspector-general of police (IGP) and the government for allegedly failing to arrest her ex-husband and return her daughter, who he abducted. In his ruling, judicial commissioner Datuk Raja Ahmad Mohzanuddin Shah Raja Mohzan stated that the police had used all available resources to locate the wanted man. Indira's daughter Prasana Diksa was snatched from her 15 years ago and is believed to be with her ex-husband, K. Pathmanathan. The court said in order for the plaintiff, (Indira Gandhi) to succeed in the tort of nonfeasance, she must demonstrate the existence of malice or bad faith. ""It is impossible for me to conclude that the IGP and police did not attempt to locate Patmanathan. ""Furthermore, this is certainly not a scenario in which Patmanathan was roaming around Kuala Lumpur or any other area in the presence of the police, without the police taking any action despite noticing his appearance. ""If this were the case, I would have viewed that factor in favour of the plaintiff. ""However, the facts before me indicate that Patmanathan's whereabouts were unknown. Evidence further suggests that he was in Thailand at some point in time,"" he said. Mohzanuddin said the evidence suggested that all the efforts made by the IGP and police were not indicative of any neglect of their duties. ""Based on the evidence available to me, I conclude that the IGP and police exercised their duties in the manner they considered to be most appropriate. ""The manner in which they conducted their investigation is within their wide discretion, and I am in no position to second-guess them. ""Essentially, what matters to me is that there is evidence that an investigation has been conducted and is still in progress,"" he said, adding that neither the IGP nor the police had any ill intention in this matter. Indira filed the suit on Oct 28, 2020, by naming former IGP Tan Sri Abdul Hamid Bador, the Royal Malaysia Police, Home Ministry, and the government as the first, second, third, and fourth defendants, respectively. In her statement of claim, Indira accused the first defendant (Hamid) of committing negligence by failing to execute a warrant issued by the Federal Court eight years ago. She claimed that Hamid had knowingly, recklessly and maliciously failed to take all necessary steps to apprehend Pathmanathan, now known as Muhammad Riduan Abdullah, and retrieve Prasana. She claimed that the second, third, and fourth defendants were vicariously liable for the first defendant's act of nonfeasance. It was reported that Pathmanathan took Prasana away after unilaterally converting all of their three children to Islam in 2009. Prasana was just 11 months old at the time. On Jan 29, 2018, the Federal Court ruled that the unilateral conversion of their three children by Riduan, a Muslim convert, as null and void. In a 99-page judgment read out by Federal Court judge Tan Sri Zainun Ali, the court ruled that the consent of both parents was needed to convert a minor."

"Hidden in a plantation, illegal e-waste factory raked in over RM10mil monthly [WATCH]",Ahmad Mukhsein Mukhtar,"June 27, 2024 @ 2:55pm","SUNGAI PETANI: Imagine over RM10 million worth of precious metals being extracted monthly from an illegal e-waste recycling facility, hidden within a palm oil plantation in Tikam Batu. This facility, raided by authorities today, has been a hub for extracting metals such as copper, aluminum, and iron, causing severe environmental damage. Nestled discreetly, the operation run by local and Chinese nationals, exploiting Bangladeshi labour workers, was hidden in plain sight. A female Chinese employee detained during the raid, claimed the 160,000 sq ft facility was leased by her employers, who rake in nine-digit annual incomes. ""We receive truckloads of e-waste daily, sourced locally and internationally, and extract metals like aluminum, copper, and iron, my employers make well over RM100 million annually,"" she told the NST after she was detained. The employee, in her 50s, claimed she earns a meagre 2,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately RM1,300) monthly and was deceived into the job by her employers. Allegedly desperate for work, she left her legitimate engineering job in Hangzhou, China, after similar operations shut down when China banned the import of e-waste. ""I came here earlier this year and was tricked into this, I thought I was signing up for a legitimate recycling facility. ""My employers here are local Malaysians, they also own the palm oil estate. They come here once a month to check the operations, but they're not around today,"" claimed the detainee, who entered the country in March this year. Checks by the NST during the raid found documents showing the facility's transactions with local and foreign companies selling industrial waste and purchasing processed extracted metals. For the record, China banned the import of e-waste effective in January 2018, causing some developed countries to transport the waste to other Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Malaysia. This led to some Chinese manufacturers setting up factories in these countries, in some cases, operating illegitimately. Meanwhile, state Department of Environment (DoE) director Sharifah Zakiah Syed Sahab said over 350 metric tonnes of e-waste were seized during the raid. She said the raid was conducted after two months of surveillance by the department. ""A stop-work order on the facility was taken under Section 38 (1)(a) of the Environmental Quality Act 1974 for illegal recovery of scheduled waste without approval. The case will be investigated under Sections 18(1), 34A(1), and 34B(1) of the Act,"" she said. Sharifah added the illegal e-waste recovery could cause environmental pollution, including illegal waste disposal and air and water contamination. ""Nine Bangladeshi and a Chinese national were also detained for various immigration offenses,"" she added. She also warned landowners to monitor activities on their properties to avoid legal consequences. Yesterday, Natural Resources Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad declared ""war"" on illegal waste import syndicates, vowing aggressive action against unregistered facilities operating."

High Court Judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh made the ruling before dismissing the applicant's leave (permission) application to initiate the judicial review today. The judge, in his ruling, said the Bar failed to meet the provisions required under Section 96 of the Court of Judicature Act to be allowed to initiate the proceedings. The court also ruled that the applicant (the Bar) failed to present clear evidence to rebut the legal presumption that the decision and actions of the Attorney-General (AG) to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the deputy prime minister were lawful. ""The AG is not obligated to provide the information, documentation, reasons, basis, and details that were relied upon to reach the decision to apply for a DNAA against Zahid, as demanded by the applicant,"" he said. The court also dismissed the Bar's application to refer three constitutional questions regarding its challenge on Zahid's DNAA to the Federal Court for determination. The court awarded RM10,000 in cost to the paid by the applicant. Senior federal counsels Ahmad Hanir Hambaly and Shamsul Bolhassan appeared for the Attorney-General's Chambers while Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Hamidi Mohd Noh and Guok Ngek Seong appeared for Zahid, who is deputy prime minister and Umno president. The Malaysian Bar was represented by lawyers Steven Thiru and Abhilaash Subramaniam. The Bar Council, in an application filed on Dec 2, last year, had named the AG and Zahid as respondents in their application for the DNAA decision to be rescinded. The Bar, as the sole applicant, had applied for a mandamus order from the court to instruct the AG to act in accordance with the law and if applicable, act under Section 254A of the Criminal Procedure Code to prosecute Zahid again. It had also sought an order for the AG to provide the Bar with information on the status of further investigations into Zahid's case, including any move to file new charges, proceed with the trial, or cancel investigations. On Sept 4, last year, Zahid who is also the Bagan Datuk member of parliament, was freed of all 47 graft charges he faced after the prosecution applied for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal against him. However, Court of Appeal judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah, who presided as the High Court judge, refused to grant full acquittal against Zahid by stating that the AG has the authority to initiate and withdraw charges at any time before a judgement is rendered. Sequerah also noted that judicial time and a great amount of taxpayers' money would have been wasted if the prosecution decided not to proceed with the case."

"Azizi files legal bid to halt by-election, challenges termination from Bersatu",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 26, 2024 @ 4:00pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former Nenggiri assemblyman Mohd Azizi Abu Naim has filed a legal bid to halt the upcoming by-election in Kelantan. He is also seeking to challenge his termination from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu). Azizi filed the originating summons at the High Court here on Monday by naming the party president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, secretary-general Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainuddin and Kelantan state assembly speaker's Datuk Seri Mohd Amar Abdullah as defendants. In the originating summons, Azizi seeks a declaration that the by-election for the Nenggiri state seat cannot be conducted by the Election Commission (SPR) because he still holds the seat. The plaintiff is seeking a court declaration that his dismissal from his position and membership in Bersatu through a notice dated June 12 is an unlawful dismissal. He is also seeking court declaration that the notification letter from Mohd Amar to the EC stating that the Nenggiri state legislative assembly seat is vacant, is suspended. The plaintiff also seeks a declaration that the notification letter is invalid and void, and that his dismissal from Bersatu was malicious. Azizi asserts that the amendment to Article 10 of the party constitution, which stipulates that membership will cease if one supports a political rival, is unconstitutional. The case will be heard before High Court judicial commissioner Roz Mawar Rozain tomorrow. On June 19, the Kelantan state assembly declared the Nenggiri state seat vacant after Azizi's termination from representing Bersatu was notified on June 13. Following the revocation of Azizi's membership, Amar said the state assembly decided to vacate the seat effective today in accordance with Phase Three of Article 31(A) of the state constitution. He added that according to Article 31(A)(4) of the state constitution, the unexpectedly vacant seat needs to be filled within 60 days from the day the EC receives the notice. On June 12, Bersatu secretary-general Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin said the party had revoked the memberships of six elected representatives. Hamzah said the party issued notices to the six members, initiating their expulsion without delay. Hamzah said the process was in line with the foundation of the party constitution and the country's laws under Article 49(A) of the Federal Constitution and/or under the related state government laws. Last year, six Bersatu MPs 'went rogue'. They are Gua Musang MP Mohd Azizi Abu Naim, Labuan MP Datuk Dr Suhaili Abdul Rahman, Zahari Kechik (Jeli), Iskandar Dzulkarnain Abdul Khalid (Kuala Kangsar), Syed Abu Hussin Hafiz Syed Abdul Fasal (Bukit Gantang), and Datuk Dr Zulkafperi Hanapi (Tanjong Karang)."

""Rule 6 of the Judges' Code of Ethics 2009 clearly states that 'a judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.' ""The defendant asserts that the principles outlined in this rule will be compromised if the current judge continues to hear this matter.

The plaintiffs are seeking a court order to compel Rosmah to pay US$346,010,489 or such other sum as to be assessed by the court. They are also seeking damages or fair compensation to be determined by the court. On May 10, 2022, 1MDB filed a combined total of 22 civil suits against various parties, including Najib to recover RM96.6 billion in assets. The Finance Ministry in a statement said six of the 22 writs were filed by 1MDB, while the remaining 16 were by its former subsidiary SRC International Sdn Bhd. The civil suits were filed as an effort by both entities to recover their assets with a combined total in excess of RM96.6 billion including approximately RM300 million against various local parties.

Low Mong Tuan, who is the banking services manager of Public Bank Bhd's Jalan Sultan Sulaiman branch, said Wan Saiful & Associates Sdn Bhd had transferred the funds to Tagami Auto Enterprise Sdn Bhd via money transfer on Aug 12, 2022. Low, who previously served at the bank's Sungai Chua Branch, said the account was opened under the name Tagami Auto Enterprise at the branch on Jan 7, 2008.

Wan Saiful, as the director of WA Advisory Group Sdn Bhd, was accused of transferring RM78,800, derived from illegal activities, from the company's CIMB Bank account to Tagami Auto Enterprise Sdn Bhd's Public Bank account as payment for the purchase of a Ford Ranger pickup truck. Wan Saiful's counsel, Chetan Jethwani, asked Low if he knew at the time that the transaction was deemed suspicious, to which Low replied in the negative. To a question from deputy public prosecutor Rasyidah Murni Adzmi Low said he only realised it when he received an email from the head office, stating that documents related to the transaction needed to be provided to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC).

Couple trapped in loan scam web,Mohd Haris Fadli Mohd Fadzil,"June 25, 2024 @ 2:23pm","KAJANG: A married couple found themselves ensnared in a loan scam that escalated into threats and financial coercion after a dubious ""money-lending company"" unexpectedly deposited RM1,200 into their account on June 14. The victim, Yuan, 44, recounted feeling anxious and intimidated when the company not only demanded repayment but also threatened his family members with a steep RM10,000 payment for a loan they never agreed to. The ordeal began when Yuan's wife came across an online advertisement for a loan from a company named ""Yayasan Madani,"" initially believing it to be legitimate due to its name association with a foundation. Intrigued, she contacted the company via WhatsApp, providing personal and business details as requested to purportedly check eligibility. ""Initially, they mentioned we could secure a RM50,000 loan but needed to proceed with a trial loan of RM2,000, from which we would receive only RM1,200 in cash, with the remainder supposedly being a processing fee,"" Yuan explained during a press conference at DAPSY Bandar Mahkota Cheras. Concerned about the high charges and unsure about the company's legitimacy, Yuan and his wife decided against proceeding with the loan. However, they were shocked when the company informed them that RM1,200 had already been deposited into their account without authorisation. ""I contacted the agent to request a bank account but after making the money transfer, another agent contacted me and claimed not to have received the money,"" he said. Attempts to return the money were met with resistance from the company, claiming the transaction was irreversible due to system closure. Matters worsened when an agent alleged that Yuan mistakenly transferred the funds to another account and demanded a hefty RM10,000 repayment. Distressed over the safety of their children and other family members, as the company possessed personal information obtained during the application process, Yuan and his wife immediately filed a police report. They were advised to refrain from making any interest payments demanded and to return the transferred funds immediately. Selangor DAP Complaints Bureau Chief Lee Wen Bin cautioned the public about such syndicates' fraudulent tactics, urging victims not to comply with unwarranted demands for interest payments and to swiftly return any mistakenly transferred funds."

Insurance fraud syndicate exposed: Murder for policy payouts [WATCH],Izz Laily Hussein,"June 25, 2024 @ 10:58am","JOHOR BARU: Police have uncovered a chilling insurance fraud scheme where ""agents"" identify policyholders living alone, make premium payments without their knowledge, and then kill them to claim life insurance payouts of up to RM500,000. The scheme came to light following the murder of a 38-year-old man on Jalan Senai-Seelong around 4.40am on May 6. Johor police chief Commissioner M Kumar said that while the death was initially reported as a fatal accident, further investigation revealed a sinister plot. ""The victim, reported to have been hit by a lorry, was actually crushed and hit by suspects using two cars and a motorcycle. When he survived, he was beaten and left on the road, where a passing lorry ultimately struck him, resulting in his death,"" he said at a press conference. The syndicate's method involved forging the victim's signature to obtain an insurance policy and appointing a beneficiary unknown to the victim. Once the policy was approved, they planned and executed the victim's murder to stage it as a fatal accident, ensuring the insurance claim could be made. Eight local men aged 23 to 49 have been arrested, with four having prior criminal records. Police have also confiscated the victim's insurance policy and three vehicles used in the crime. ""The case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code. ""Four suspects were charged in court on June 19, while others were released on bail. We are actively tracking several more suspects who remain at large,"" he added."

The 27-year-old woman, Siti Amiza Baharuddin, also known as 'Miza Ozawa', had pleaded guilty to the offence last week. Shahrul Rizal: Where are you from? Siti Amiza: Penang. Shahrul Rizal: What do you want to do after this? Siti Amiza: I want to open a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur and take care of my baby. Shahrul Rizal: Why Kuala Lumpur? Who do you have here?

The charge under Section 372B of the Penal Code provides for a jail term of not more than a year or a fine, or both. Meanwhile, Siti Amiza, in her appeal, asked the court to impose a lenient sentence and not to incarcerate her. ""I am pregnant and I regret my past actions. I plead for a fine instead of imprisonment. ""I promise not to repeat the same offence and want to start a new life. I want to take care of this child after losing my first one. ""I cannot be in prison as it could affect my mental health and cause stress,"" she said in between tears. Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurul Afiqah Abdul Ghaffar pressed for a deterrent sentence due to public interest and the nature of the offence, which involved solicitation. ""The offence committed by the accused is immoral and can undermine societal morals, in addition to increasing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases,"" she said."

"[UPDATED] Eight arrested over IS-linked threats against King, PM",Austin Camoens,"June 24, 2024 @ 5:05pm","PUTRAJAYA: Six men and two women have been arrested by police for alleged ties to the Islamic State terror group. Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the suspects, including a retired lecturer, were arrested by Special Branch E8 (Counter Terrorism) policemen. This followed operations in Johor, Kelantan, Penang and Selangor over the weekend. ""Our investigations revealed that there were threats of attacks against His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, the King of Malaysia, the prime minister (Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim) and other dignitaries, including the top brass of the police force,"" he told reporters at the Home Ministry. Also present during the press conference was Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain and Special Branch deputy director (II) Datuk Abdul Aziz Abdul Majid. Saifuddin said the eight suspects, aged between 25 and 70, have been detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma). ""These arrests were made following other operations by E8 on May 15, 17 and 30. ""The suspects came from various employment backgrounds and economic status. ""Amongst the eight arrested are a housewife, construction worker, former university lecturer and an unemployed individual,"" he said. Saifuddin added that further investigations were being conducted to establish a connection between the eight. When asked if the eight were connected to the Ulu Tiram police station attack, Saifuddin said police were still investigating. ""Special Branch is working continuously on this matter and we will not link the arrests to any incidents (yet),"" he said. In the May 17 attack at the police station in Johor, a masked intruder shot dead two policemen and wounded another before being killed himself. Two students who were at the station at the time were arrested on the probability that they could have been there to distract the policemen on duty. However, they were later released. His five family members — his parents, a brother and two sisters — have since been hit with terror-related charges linked to IS. Saifuddin also advised Malaysians to be attentive and sensitive to threats of new forms by elements of extremism, radicalism and violence. He said these threats abused the development of modern technology and misused social media to spread harmful ideas. Saifuddin reiterated the Malaysian government's stand that there would be no compromise against any party who is an instigator, perpetrator, supporter or sympathisers of elements of extremism, radicalism and violence in this country. ""The authorities will not hesitate to take the most severe enforcement action on this group. ""Therefore, the government urges the public including community activists, organisations as well as non-governmental organisations and private parties to work together to stop this threat from affecting the unity and peace of the country,"" he said. Saifuddin gave his assurances to the public against feeling upset or anxious about the level of security and public order in Malaysia. He said the police force was working with efficiency and agility to repel threats of extremism, radicalism and terrorism."

Woman fails in bid to nullify conversion to Islam,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 24, 2024 @ 2:38pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A 56-year-old woman failed to nullify her conversion to Islam, which she alleged was ""illegally"" done by her former husband 34 years ago. Judicial Commissioner Roz Mawar Rozain made the ruling after dismissing a legal bid filed by the woman, who also brought her three children as plaintiffs in their attempt to renounce their status as Muslims. They named the Malaysian Islamic Welfare Organisation (Perkim) permanent chairman, Federal Territories Islamic Religious Council (MAIWP) and Selangor National Registration Department director as defendants. According to the facts of the case, the woman (first plaintiff) married her former husband on March 23, 1990, in Kedah by way of Hindu rites and the marriage was recorded in the civil registry. In early April 1990, the first plaintiff became aware that her husband was a Muslim when she was pregnant with her second daughter. Her husband then gave the first plaintiff a copy of an Islamic conversion card dated Nov 8, 1990, which bore her photo, and told her that she was a Muslim. Throughout the marriage, she was frequently physically abused by her husband, who threatened her whenever she wanted to inform the authorities that the purported conversion was not valid. In 2007, the husband left the matrimonial home, and the family has had no contact with him since. In 2016, the first plaintiff filed a suit against the Selangor Islamic Religious Council to declare that she was no longer a Muslim, but it was dismissed by the Syariah Court on April 22, 2021. In her suit at the present court, the first plaintiff contended that her conversion to Islam was invalid and unlawful as she never uttered the syahadah as required under Sections 85 and 86 of the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act 1993. The plaintiffs' case is that they were never Muslims to begin with and had always practised Hinduism. MAIWP argued that based on documents from the proceedings in the Syariah Court filed by the first plaintiff herself, she had affirmed that she embraced Islam on Nov 8, 1990. MAIWP maintained that this is not a case where the first plaintiff was never a Muslim, but one where she is seeking to renounce Islam, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. Roz Mawar, in her judgment, said it was the Syariah High Court's findings that the first plaintiff's conversion into Islam was properly conducted based on documentary evidence and witness testimony. She said the Syariah Court also held that the first plaintiff had been taught the syahadah and her conversion was duly registered with Perkim, which then issued her a conversion certificate. The judge said this case is distinguishable from the precedent case of Rosliza Ibrahim in that there was no evidence that the latter had ever professed Islam. ""In contrast, the evidence here shows that the first plaintiff had affirmed on affidavit in her divorce proceedings before Syariah Court that she was a Muslim. ""Unlike Rosliza, the first plaintiff here had made several averments of her status as a Muslim and had submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court, which had ruled on the matter. ""Accordingly, this court finds that the case of Rosliza Ibrahim does not assist the plaintiffs,"" she said in her ground of judgment dated yesterday. Roz Mawar said the Syariah Court had considered the first plaintiff's contention that her conversion was involuntary and resulted from deception and fraud by her former husband. ""The trial judge specifically found that the first plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence to show that her conversion was materialised by way of force, compulsion, fraud or misrepresentation. ""The Syariah Court's decision, therefore, constitutes a valid and binding pronouncement of the very issue now sought to be raised by the first plaintiff in this action, namely the validity of her conversion to Islam."" ""The Syariah Court's findings operate as res judicata and preclude the first plaintiff from agitating the same issue before the civil courts,"" she said, adding that to allow the present action to proceed would be tantamount to sitting on an appeal or review of the Syariah Court's decision. She said the plaintiff's case falls within the category of renunciation of Islam, rather than a person who was never a Muslim to begin with, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court by virtue of Article 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution. ""The case advanced by the plaintiffs, though tugging at the strings of sympathy, cannot be sustained when examined in the cold light of day. ""To allow her to now resile from those statements and mount a collateral attack on the findings of the Syariah Courts would be to countenance and abuse of the judicial process. ""She cannot be allowed to have a second bite at the cherry by seeking to re-litigate the matter all over again in this forum,"" she added. The court also awarded RM20,000 in cost to the defendants."

Kadir, representing Annamah, argued that his client's role was minimal in merely signalling Puganeswaran with a missed call and opening the door to allow the teenagers into the house. Meanwhile, deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Ng Siew Wee requested for the death sentence to be upheld, arguing that the murder was meticulously planned and pointing out that Annamah had betrayed her marriage by engaging in a relationship with Puganeswaran. ""The murder was carried out through a conspiracy, manipulating four underage teenagers to execute their malicious plan. Puganeswaran promised to pay the teenagers RM5,000 once they completed the murder, using the victim's EPF savings,"" she said. The prosecution was handled by DPPs Ng Siew Wee and Norzilati Izhani Zainal @ Zainol. In 2017, the Shah Alam High Court sentenced Puganeswaran and Annamah to death for the murder of lorry driver G.

Shahrul Rizal: What do you want to do after this? Siti Amiza: I want to open a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur and take care of my baby. Shahrul Rizal: Why Kuala Lumpur? Who do you have here? Why not Penang? Siti Amiza: I have friends here. Shahrul Rizal: Go back to Penang. You have no relatives in Kuala Lumpur, and you cannot rely on friends. Stay with your family if you really want to take care of your child. According to the charge sheet, Siti Amiza had solicited online subscriptions for the purpose of prostitution. She committed the offence about 4pm on June 6 at a residence in Bandar Bukit Mahkota in Kajang. The charge under Section 372B of the Penal Code provides for a jail term of not more than a year or a fine, or both. Meanwhile, Siti Amiza, in her appeal, asked the court to impose a lenient sentence and not to incarcerate her. ""I am pregnant and I regret my past actions. I plead for a fine instead of imprisonment. ""I promise not to repeat the same offence and want to start a new life. I want to take care of this child after losing my first one. ""I cannot be in prison as it could affect my mental health and cause stress,"" she said in between tears. Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurul Afiqah Abdul Ghaffar pressed for a deterrent sentence due to public interest and the nature of the offence, which involved solicitation. ""The offence committed by the accused is immoral and can undermine societal morals, in addition to increasing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases,"" she said."

"[UPDATED] Eight arrested over IS-linked threats against King, PM",Austin Camoens,"June 24, 2024 @ 5:05pm","PUTRAJAYA: Six men and two women have been arrested by police for alleged ties to the Islamic State terror group. Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the suspects, including a retired lecturer, were arrested by Special Branch E8 (Counter Terrorism) policemen. This followed operations in Johor, Kelantan, Penang and Selangor over the weekend. ""Our investigations revealed that there were threats of attacks against His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, the King of Malaysia, the prime minister (Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim) and other dignitaries, including the top brass of the police force,"" he told reporters at the Home Ministry. Also present during the press conference was Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain and Special Branch deputy director (II) Datuk Abdul Aziz Abdul Majid. Saifuddin said the eight suspects, aged between 25 and 70, have been detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma). ""These arrests were made following other operations by E8 on May 15, 17 and 30. ""The suspects came from various employment backgrounds and economic status. ""Amongst the eight arrested are a housewife, construction worker, former university lecturer and an unemployed individual,"" he said. Saifuddin added that further investigations were being conducted to establish a connection between the eight. When asked if the eight were connected to the Ulu Tiram police station attack, Saifuddin said police were still investigating. ""Special Branch is working continuously on this matter and we will not link the arrests to any incidents (yet),"" he said. In the May 17 attack at the police station in Johor, a masked intruder shot dead two policemen and wounded another before being killed himself. Two students who were at the station at the time were arrested on the probability that they could have been there to distract the policemen on duty. However, they were later released. His five family members — his parents, a brother and two sisters — have since been hit with terror-related charges linked to IS. Saifuddin also advised Malaysians to be attentive and sensitive to threats of new forms by elements of extremism, radicalism and violence. He said these threats abused the development of modern technology and misused social media to spread harmful ideas. Saifuddin reiterated the Malaysian government's stand that there would be no compromise against any party who is an instigator, perpetrator, supporter or sympathisers of elements of extremism, radicalism and violence in this country. ""The authorities will not hesitate to take the most severe enforcement action on this group. ""Therefore, the government urges the public including community activists, organisations as well as non-governmental organisations and private parties to work together to stop this threat from affecting the unity and peace of the country,"" he said. Saifuddin gave his assurances to the public against feeling upset or anxious about the level of security and public order in Malaysia. He said the police force was working with efficiency and agility to repel threats of extremism, radicalism and terrorism."

Woman fails in bid to nullify conversion to Islam,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 24, 2024 @ 2:38pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A 56-year-old woman failed to nullify her conversion to Islam, which she alleged was ""illegally"" done by her former husband 34 years ago. Judicial Commissioner Roz Mawar Rozain made the ruling after dismissing a legal bid filed by the woman, who also brought her three children as plaintiffs in their attempt to renounce their status as Muslims. They named the Malaysian Islamic Welfare Organisation (Perkim) permanent chairman, Federal Territories Islamic Religious Council (MAIWP) and Selangor National Registration Department director as defendants. According to the facts of the case, the woman (first plaintiff) married her former husband on March 23, 1990, in Kedah by way of Hindu rites and the marriage was recorded in the civil registry. In early April 1990, the first plaintiff became aware that her husband was a Muslim when she was pregnant with her second daughter. Her husband then gave the first plaintiff a copy of an Islamic conversion card dated Nov 8, 1990, which bore her photo, and told her that she was a Muslim. Throughout the marriage, she was frequently physically abused by her husband, who threatened her whenever she wanted to inform the authorities that the purported conversion was not valid. In 2007, the husband left the matrimonial home, and the family has had no contact with him since. In 2016, the first plaintiff filed a suit against the Selangor Islamic Religious Council to declare that she was no longer a Muslim, but it was dismissed by the Syariah Court on April 22, 2021. In her suit at the present court, the first plaintiff contended that her conversion to Islam was invalid and unlawful as she never uttered the syahadah as required under Sections 85 and 86 of the Administration of Islamic Law (Federal Territories) Act 1993. The plaintiffs' case is that they were never Muslims to begin with and had always practised Hinduism. MAIWP argued that based on documents from the proceedings in the Syariah Court filed by the first plaintiff herself, she had affirmed that she embraced Islam on Nov 8, 1990. MAIWP maintained that this is not a case where the first plaintiff was never a Muslim, but one where she is seeking to renounce Islam, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. Roz Mawar, in her judgment, said it was the Syariah High Court's findings that the first plaintiff's conversion into Islam was properly conducted based on documentary evidence and witness testimony. She said the Syariah Court also held that the first plaintiff had been taught the syahadah and her conversion was duly registered with Perkim, which then issued her a conversion certificate. The judge said this case is distinguishable from the precedent case of Rosliza Ibrahim in that there was no evidence that the latter had ever professed Islam. ""In contrast, the evidence here shows that the first plaintiff had affirmed on affidavit in her divorce proceedings before Syariah Court that she was a Muslim. ""Unlike Rosliza, the first plaintiff here had made several averments of her status as a Muslim and had submitted herself to the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court, which had ruled on the matter. ""Accordingly, this court finds that the case of Rosliza Ibrahim does not assist the plaintiffs,"" she said in her ground of judgment dated yesterday. Roz Mawar said the Syariah Court had considered the first plaintiff's contention that her conversion was involuntary and resulted from deception and fraud by her former husband. ""The trial judge specifically found that the first plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence to show that her conversion was materialised by way of force, compulsion, fraud or misrepresentation. ""The Syariah Court's decision, therefore, constitutes a valid and binding pronouncement of the very issue now sought to be raised by the first plaintiff in this action, namely the validity of her conversion to Islam."" ""The Syariah Court's findings operate as res judicata and preclude the first plaintiff from agitating the same issue before the civil courts,"" she said, adding that to allow the present action to proceed would be tantamount to sitting on an appeal or review of the Syariah Court's decision. She said the plaintiff's case falls within the category of renunciation of Islam, rather than a person who was never a Muslim to begin with, which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Syariah Court by virtue of Article 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution. ""The case advanced by the plaintiffs, though tugging at the strings of sympathy, cannot be sustained when examined in the cold light of day. ""To allow her to now resile from those statements and mount a collateral attack on the findings of the Syariah Courts would be to countenance and abuse of the judicial process. ""She cannot be allowed to have a second bite at the cherry by seeking to re-litigate the matter all over again in this forum,"" she added. The court also awarded RM20,000 in cost to the defendants."

The investigation is carried out under the Control of Supplies Act 1961. Azman said checks showed that some motorists are still ignoring the directive on not making repeat fuel purchases for the same vehicle in one hour. The ministry, he said, will continue to closely monitor the developments. He said special attention is being given to 48 out of 245 petrol stations in Kelantan, as they are located within a 25km radius from the Thai border.

Before delivering the sentence, Judge Abu Bakar informed the court that they also considered the social report along with accused's family background. ""Looking at this social report, you do not have many problems, despite academic shortcomings,"" said the judge. ""(However) you represented the school and district in football, so teachers are confident in your achievements. I hope when you are released, you will continue to strive to achieve your aspirations (to become a soldier),"" he argued. Deputy Public Prosecutor Danial Munir prosecuted while the accused was not represented. Earlier, the prosecution requested the court impose a fair sentence considering public interest and the victim's age. The court then ordered the accused to serve his sentence at the Henry Gurney School, Melaka, in line with Section 76 of the Child Act. He will also be placed under police supervision for a year after completing the sentence under Section 27 of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act."

Dobevil: The scam that smashed a national shuttler's life savings,New Straits Times,"June 23, 2024 @ 9:01am","KUALA LUMPUR: National mixed doubles shuttler Lai Pei Jing invested in Dobevil to shore up her finances, but in the end lost nearly all of her life's savings. The 31-year-old is not the only victim of the Dobevil scam. Earlier this month, Federal Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said they received two reports linked to the Dobevil and Dobemall apps involving losses of around RM540,600. Dobevil According to Lai, Dobevil works like a cross-border e-commerce platform. A quick search pulls up links to the Dobevil website and app. The landing page for the website appears like other e-commerce sites, though unlike popular e-commerce sites, there are no links to an ""About Us"" or ""Contact Us"" page. In Lai's case, she was introduced to Dobevil by a friend but in other cases reported, victims found out about Dobevil through social media ads. A check on data service provider ScamAdviser raised some red flags including a lack of information on the website's owner, the sale of high-end brands at low prices and low website traffic among others. How Lai was scammed Lai said DoBeVil runs like an ""online store"" involving regular processes including order taking, procurement, manufacturer shipping and buyer signing. However, the entire process, including buying is controlled by the scammers. Although orders piled up, she was required to invest more money to keep her business running. She was told her account would be frozen if she failed to do so. She suspected something was amiss when the amount of orders grew too big. She then told her family but by then, had lost around RM400,000. How others were scammed According to Ramli, two victims in Selangor and Sarawak were told to use Dobevil and Dobemall to make purchases with the promise of making money from commissions. However, they were charged fees when they tried to withdraw their money. The police are probing both apps including the link between Dobevil and Dobemall. Then, Ramli said the police would work with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission to take down Dobemall. A check revealed that the app is no longer available for download. When contacted Ramli said they were investigating the Dobevil website which is still accessible. ""At the same time, we also urge anyone who has been scammed by the website or apps to come forward immediately. ""We need as much information as possible from victims to get to the bottom of this issue and stop more people from being scammed,"" he said. Those with information on Dobevil should the National Scam Response Centre (NSRC) at 997, he said. Ramli advised the public to be cautious when making purchases or taking part in investments online."

"Horny old man, out-of-luck worker and heart patient among customers netted in vice raid",New Straits Times,"June 22, 2024 @ 5:04pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Police raided several premises in an anti-vice operation in the city's oldest red-light district that is still operational to this day. The operation near the food court and buildings in Jalan Gelang and Jalan Kalong, Pudu, here, was conducted by the Vice, Gambling, and Organised Crime Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Department following an exclusive report on sex services being offered in the area from RM100 onwards. The area is among the oldest prostitution dens in the Klang Valley and is still operational. Currently, it is an attraction point for old men who seek the companionship of Chinese and Vietnamese women. However, some of those arrested on suspicion of offering sexual services were not only young women, but also those aged between 40 and 50. One 58-year-old male customer who was netted in the operation said he had been frequenting the area since his youth nearly 20 years ago. ""Even though I have erectile dysfunction, I still come here to get a body massage and satisfy my desires. ""I don't go to the food court because it requires spending a lot on food, drinks and flower garlands, which would easily cost up to RM300,"" he said. Since he was a regular customer, he said he had a Chinese woman contact who offered him services and went up directly to her room in the next building. ""For the past 20 years I have been visiting here and until now, the price has remained the same, which is only RM100. This place is not new, but it is as old as I am."" During the raid, the man asked not to be photographed because he was worried that his family would know about his immoral activities. ""Don't take my picture,"" he said. For a younger customer caught in the raid, he believed that he was unlucky and it was just not his day. ""When it's wrong, it's wrong. There's no luck (when you get caught), just confess,"" he said after being netted in Jalan Gelang. The 35-year-old factory worker said he was introduced to the location by a friend. ""After working hours, I came here to drink (at the food court). They (suspected sex workers) come to me offering services for a fee of RM100. ""Don't do it, bro (asking the cameraman not to record him). Don't make it difficult for me. It will be hard for my family and work, too,"" he said. There is also a customer approaching his sixth decade, who is undeterred despite catching chlamydia twice from the prostitutes he frequented. The man also suffered from heart disease and brought along his medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol. ""I have been sexually deprived for more than 14 years without being with my wife. If my wife asks (about the arrest), I say it is because of you that I am deprived and unable to meet my needs. We have been sleeping in different rooms for a long time because she refuses to have sex."" The man said that he did not go through any middlemen to get his sexual services, but instead, he contacted the women directly. A young Chinese woman who said she had been working in the industry since age 15 was also among those detained in the raid. Vice, Gambling, and Organised Crime Investigation Division (D7) deputy director Mohamad Farouk Eshak said 27 individuals, including guest relations officers (GROs) and suspected prostitutes, were arrested. Several local men acting as managers, Indonesian female cashiers and two Myanmar male cleaners were also detained."

The court's three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Azizah Nawawi, Datuk Lim Chong Fong and Datuk Wong Kian Kheong allowed O'Luanaigh's appeal to overturn a High Court's decision which had ruled that the alleged statements made by the chef were not defamatory of O'Luanaigh. In delivering the court's decision, Justice Azizah ordered Chef Wan to pay RM150,000 in general, aggravated and exemplary damages to O'Luanaigh, and RM40,000 in costs for proceedings in the High Court and Court of Appeal. She also granted a perpetual injunction prohibiting the chef from publishing defamatory statements of his former Irish son-in-law. She also ordered Chef Wan to pay interest of five per cent per annum from the date of filing of the writ of summons until the final settlement of the judgment sum. In delivering the court's broad grounds, Justice Wong said the court found that the postings had defamed O'Luanaigh. He also said the chef had breached an undertaking to the court not to post the defamatory statements against O'Luanaigh. O'Luanaigh, whose Muslim name is Salahudin Ghaffar, was married to Chef Wan's actress daughter, Serina, in 2010 before their divorce in August 2017. He filed the suit in February 2021 claiming that eight social media postings by his former father-in-law were on him and his present wife and were defamatory of them. In his statement of defence, Chef Wan said the statements published in the postings were based on facts, were fair comments, protected by absolute and qualified privileges and were made without malicious intent. On May 11, 2023, the Shah Alam High Court partly allowed O'Luanaigh's claim for an injunction to restrain his former father-in-law from publishing any libellous and false allegations against him. The High Court judge Rozi Bainon also ordered Chef Wan to remove all eight postings complained of by O' Luanaigh. The judge, however, held that the impugned statements were not defamatory of O'Luanaigh and were not published with malicious intent. O'Luanaigh was represented by lawyers Nur Khidmah Huzaisham and Nur Dalilah Zainol Abidin while Datuk M. Reza Hassan represented Chef Wan."

Ex-SRC director: I was just the company's rubber stamp,Dawn Chan,"June 20, 2024 @ 5:15pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former SRC International Bhd director Datuk Suboh Md Yassin said he had throughout his tenure in the company merely served as a rubber stamp to carry out the behest of the top, namely former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the advisor emeritus. Suboh, 73, who was the company's non-executive director, said the affairs in SRC were singularly directed by one person, its ex-chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, who was Najib's proxy and had acted on his behalf. Suboh said any communication between Najib and the directors would be conveyed via Nik Faisal,who would only approach him if there were documents to be signed. ""My queries would regularly be brushed aside with a statement suggesting that the underlying transaction must be done at the behest of Najib like 'boss nak lah' (boss wants it) or 'diminta pihak atas' (requested by higher-ups),"" he said, referring to Najib. ""Most of the time, the document to be signed by me would already have been signed by Nik Faisal. I was required merely to countersign,"" he said when testifying as a third party witness in SRC's US$1.18 billion civil suit against Najib and Nik Faisal Ariff, who is at large.  Suboh said as a result of such ""modus operandi"", he was not in any position to verify if he had, in fact, signed certain documents or whether his signatures appearing on SRC related documents had been forged. ""I note that Nik Faisal usually used to bring a number of documents for me to sign and I would have signed them pursuant to his request. ""The same modus operandi of which I was accustomed to act and to implement equally applies to SRC's subsidiary companies,"" he said. Under cross examination by Najib's lawyer, Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, Suboh said he would not have allowed anyone to use his signature, whether it was handwritten or digital. ""But behind my back, I do not know. (Digital signature) That is more dangerous,"" he said. Suboh said Nik Faisal had hid certain things when he failed to submit SRC's 2013 financial accounts to the Companies Commission of Malaysia. Asked by Farhan if it had showed Nik Faisal's dishonesty as he had misrepresented the board on other things, Suboh said it was entirely possible. Suboh said the existence of the board was perhaps to just fulfil some perceived corporate requirements and never intended to be involved in the day-to-day running of SRC, any of its investment plans nor in the decision-making process. ""The discretion or powers of the board appears, in hindsight, to have been divested and reduced to a process of minimal oversight and giving feedback and at times caution to the management. ""Whether such caution was heeded by management, particularly Nik Faisal, is not known,"" he said. SRC, under its new management, filed the suit in May 2021, claiming that Najib had committed a breach of trust and power abuse, personally benefited from the company's funds and misappropriated the said funds. It is also seeking a court declaration that Najib is responsible for the company's losses due to his breach of duties and trust, and for Najib to pay back the RM42 million in losses that it has suffered. Najib, 70, has been serving a jail sentence at the Kajang Prison since Aug 23, 2022, after being convicted of misappropriating RM42 million in SRC International funds. The trial before High Court judge Datuk Ahmad Fairuz Zainol Abidin resumes on Monday."

""However, there were several cases in which promises were broken. Although they had made the pledge, those individuals were arrested by MACC for getting involved in corruption. ""This is really embarrassing. It is as if IBR is just a show. The promise to prevent corruption is only happening in the mouth, but not in the heart,"" he said during the IBR event at a private hospital here.   His speech was read by his deputy, Alexander S. Kunghi. Karunanithy said the pledge was a commitment by the top leadership of an organisation to show their principles related to integrity, good governance and corruption prevention. ""I would like to emphasise that the 'tone at the top' is important. However, action from the top is even more crucial. ""I believe the IBR programme today is not just a one-off event or for 'cosmetic' purposes, but it will be followed by good actions from KPJ Sabah and all its staff."" He also reminded the private hospital to look into policy, strategy and corruption prevention initiatives to ensure they are tested from time to time. Among them, he said, KPJ Sabah staff have to refrain from abusing positions and power to award projects to their own family members; refuse any graft offers; and be wary of fake or dubious claims.

The sentence was meted out by the Special Corruption Sessions Court here today. Judge Jason Juga made the decision against Roney Saimeh Sakah, 44, after finding that the defence failed to rebut the statutory presumption under Section 50(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act (MACC) 2009 on the balance of probabilities for one charge under Section 17(a) of the same act, at the end of the defence case. ""After hearing the mitigation appeal on behalf of the accused, hearing the prosecution's counterarguments, and considering the facts of the case, the nature of the offence and public interest, the accused is sentenced to one year in prison and fined RM18,000.00. ""If he fails to pay the fine, an additional three months' imprisonment will be imposed,"" he said. According to the charge, Roney received RM3,500 from Rostam Arsad in April 2017 at the Traffic Branch Office of the Lahad Datu district police headquarters as an inducement to resolve an accident case investigated under Section 41 of the Road Transport Act 1987 and to avoid charging the case in court. For this offence, the accused was charged under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act 2009, which is punishable under Section 24(1) of the same Act and, if convicted, can be imprisoned for up to 20 years and fined not less than five times the value of the bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher. The accused, who began serving with the police force since 2001, was first brought to court on Feb 20, 2020, with the full trial beginning on March 8 last year. The court heard testimony from 20 prosecution witnesses and three defence witnesses including the accused himself. Earlier, MACC Prosecutor Dzulkarnain Rousan Hasbi in his argument said that corruption is a serious offence, and is especially so when it involved a police officer as it tarnishes the reputation of other public servants and the accused himself. He said although the bribe amount in this case does not involve hundreds of thousands of ringgit, the impact of the crime is much worse, especially since it was committed by a police officer whose role is to combat crime and uphold the law. In mitigation appeal, lawyer Zahir Shah urged the court for a lighter sentence taking into account that his client is now facing financial problems and is has the responsibility of supporting his wife and a child. He requested for a stay of execution of the sentence while his defence files an appeal against the conviction and sentence in the High Court. The court granted the request for a stay of execution of the prison sentence but ordered the RM18,000 fine to be paid to the court today, and the appeal must be filed within 14 days from the date of today's conviction."

She said the counter-claim was made in response to the respondent's (1MDB) statement of claim on the issue of termination of employment. Presiding alongside Azizah were Datuk Lim Chong Fong and Datuk Dr Choo Kah Sing. Earlier in the appeal hearing, Arul Kanda's lawyer Sanjay Mohan told the court that his client is not pursuing the appeal with regard to his (Arul Kanda's) claim for abuse of process but is limiting the appeal to the proposed amendments related to the claim for outstanding salary and bonuses. The counter-claim contains two separate and distinct claims: one for the recovery of outstanding salary and bonuses due to Arul Kanda, and the other for abuse of process. In February this year, the High Court dismissed Arul Kanda's application to amend his statement of defence to include the counter-claim for both issues. Arul Kanda, who was acquitted by the criminal High Court in the 1MDB audit tampering case in March last year, is seeking, through his counter-claim, a sum of RM202,600 for loss of income, a bonus of RM2.5 million, and special damages of RM54 million (for loss of income from June 2019 to 2036) as well as general, exemplary, and aggravated damages. In his counter-claim, he said on June 25, 2018, 1MDB wrongfully terminated his contract without any basis or investigation to conclude that he had acted against the company's interests. In May 2021, 1MDB filed a lawsuit against Arul Kanda and former 1MDB chairman Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah for alleged breach of trust and conspiracy, causing 1MDB to incur losses of US$1.83 billion in connection with its investment in 1MDB-Petrosaudi Ltd, which was converted into an investment in Brazen Sky Limited, purportedly held in the Bridge Global Fund. 1MDB claimed that Arul Kanda and Mohd Irwan committed breach of trust and conspiracy by misappropriating 1MDB funds amounting to US$3.5 billion paid to Aabar Investments and US$1.265 billion paid to the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) on May 9, 2017. According to 1MDB, Irwan also conspired with Arul Kanda to cause the company to enter into the Employment Extension Agreement and make payments totalling RM2,905,200 to Arul Kanda under the agreement, disregarding 1MDB's interests and resulting in losses to the company. On Aug 23 last year, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur dismissed the bid by Arul Kanda and Mohd Irwan Serigar to strike out the US$6.59 billion lawsuit filed by 1MDB against them. Lawyers Brendan Navin Siva and Aida Haryani Salamon represented 1MDB. Representing Arul Kanda were lawyers Adam Lee and Hing Hong Jer."
"SRC International was run like a government agency, fully controlled by Najib - witness",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 19, 2024 @ 6:12pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A former SRC International Bhd director said he felt his role in the company was no different from that of a civil servant in a government agency, the High Court heard today. The company's non-executive director, Datuk Suboh Md Yassin, said all of the company's affairs were managed like a government department under the direction of the then Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak. Suboh said Najib who was also finance minister at the time had complete and absolute control over all aspects of SRC's operations, except for the board of directors. He said this when testifying in the company's RM1.18 billion civil suit against the former Pekan member of parliament and its former chief executive Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil today. He said the unusual aspect of the company's operations was the implementation of decisions through 'shareholder instructions,' which were communicated via shareholder minutes. ""I felt my role was similar to that of a civil servant, where we are accustomed to and expected to strictly follow all directives from higher authorities, in this case, from the then prime minister. ""If the top management required us to execute something, we were not in a position to oppose or reject the decision and were obligated to take all necessary steps to implement it. ""The crucial matters relating to financing, bank account openings, appointment of the chief executive officer, legal advisors, company secretary, establishment of subsidiaries, and formation of joint ventures were contained in the shareholder minutes issued by Najib."" He said in certain cases, shareholder minutes would be documented prior to the signing of any resolutions or directors' circulars by the board of directors, and occasionally, both the resolution and shareholder minutes would carry the same date. He said the actual implementation of those decisions fell under the jurisdiction of Nik Faisal who was then the chief executive. Suboh said that due to Najib's exceptional position and authority, the company's directors felt compelled to adhere to his directives as part of their fiduciary and statutory duty to act honestly and in the best interests of SRC and the nation. Meanwhile, Suboh described the establishment of SRC as peculiar due to the company's operations being controlled either directly by Najib or through his proxy, Nik Faisal. ""The company's affairs diverged from typical private limited companies, where decisions regarding standard practices and legal matters should typically fall under the independent authority of directors. ""However, all major investments and strategic decisions required prior approval from Najib, who then served as SRC's Emeritus Advisor. ""Nik Faisal, who led the management division at the time, also acted on behalf of Najib,"" he said, adding that the roles and responsibilities of other directors, including his own, were marginalised, as they were obliged to adhere to Najib's directives conveyed through shareholder minutes. SRC, under its new management, filed the suit in May 2021, claiming that Najib had committed a breach of trust and power abuse, personally benefitted from the company's funds and misappropriated the said funds. It is also seeking a court declaration that Najib is responsible for the company's losses due to his breach of duties and trust and for Najib to pay back the RM42 million in losses that it has suffered. Najib, 70, has been serving a jail sentence at the Kajang Prison since Aug 23, 2022, after being convicted of misappropriating RM42 million in SRC International funds."

Pregnant 'Miza Ozawa' pleads guilty to solicitation and porn charges,Dawn Chan,"June 19, 2024 @ 3:17pm","BANGI: A pregnant woman, popular with the moniker ""Miza Ozawa"", pleaded guilty at the Bandar Baru Bangi magistrate's court today with soliciting for the purpose of prostitution earlier this month. Siti Amiza Baharuddin, 27, made her guilty plea after the charge was read out before magistrate Nurdiyanah Mohd Nawawi. The charge sheet read that Siti Amiza had solicited subscriptions for the purpose of prostitution. She committed the offence at about 4pm at a residential premises in Bandar Bukit Mahkota in Kajang on June 6. The charge under Section 372B of the Penal Code provides for a jail term not more than a year or fine or both. The magistrate, however, fixed June 24 for facts of the case and sentencing as well as for the charge to be heard before a Sessions Court judge. The court did not offer bail. In the same proceedings, Siti Amiza was served with two more charges of possessing pornographic materials and illegal potency enhancers. On the first charge, she was jailed a month and fined RM6,500 in default seven months jail for possessing pornographic materials in her laptop and three handphones. On the second charge, she was fined RM6,000 in default six months jail time for possessing two boxes of Secret Negro and two boxes of Dara Jelita which are products not registered under the Health Ministry. She pleaded guilty to the offences which were committed at the same time, place and date. The charge under Section 292(a) of the Penal Code carries jail up to three years or fine or both; while the breach of Paragraph 7(1)(a) of the Control of Drugs and Cosmetics Regulation 1984 and the offence under Paragraph 30(1) of Sale of Drug Act provides for a maximum RM25,000 fine or imprisonment not more than three years or both. Deputy public prosecutor Siti Nur Liyana Mohd Sulaiman urged the court to mete out an appropriate sentence as a mere fine for the illegal possession of products would not serve as a lesson to the accused. She said the court should take into consideration that the case was of public interest and the sentences should be served separately. In mitigation, Siti Amiza had pleaded for a minimum bail as these were her first offences. She said she had stopped selling the illegal products early this year when she fell pregnant. ""I am six months pregnant and have HIV. The savings I kept for my delivery have been confiscated by the authorities. I am not working and supporting myself,"" she pleaded. On June 7, Bukit Aman Anti-Vice, Gambling and Secret Societies Division principal assistant director Senior Assistant Commissioner Mohamad Farouk Ehsak said a woman was arrested for her alleged involvement in promoting sexual activities and sales of sex products on social media where she could earn up to RM20,000 monthly. He had said apart from the woman, four more suspects were also arrested. He said investigations revealed that all of the suspects, including another woman, had conducted activities to promote sexual activities, selling pornographic videos and the potency enhancers on social media. The syndicate's modus operandi was to solicit subscriptions, priced between RM450 and RM500 each, on Telegram. They had used Whatsapp to contact customers to fix meet-ups with those who agreed with the sex services of the suspects. Federal Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain had said police had seized RM30,000 in cash, several mobiles and a laptop."

Cops probing use of Bentley in green investment scam,New Straits Times,"June 19, 2024 @ 2:16pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Police are investigating the use of a Bentley by a group led by a Datuk Seri who allegedly deceived investors over a green technology company. According to Harian Metro's 'Skuad Khas' report, the vehicle was used by Datuk Seri when dealing with victims to persuade them to invest in companies associated with the group. The vehicle had previously been used by a female lecturer from a public university who had been appointed as an adviser to the group. Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Commissioner Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said: ""Investigations into the fraudulent green investment scheme and another case where a film producer was deceived over a housing project are ongoing. ""Both suspects involved have not been apprehended,"" he told 'Harian Metro'. It was reported that a Datuk Seri had claimed to have lived in Denmark for 20 years and had partnerships with a green technology company in Denmark. The man claimed that his company specialised in developing green technology, biodiesel, nanotechnology and construction projects to attract investors with promising returns. He and his friends had set up companies and appointed a senior female lecturer from a public university, said to be an expert in these fields, as an adviser to the company. The woman, in her 40s, was also tasked with finding investors for a purported project to develop a green technology township in Raub, Pahang, and the Kulim International Airport in Kedah. To assure potential investors, the man and his associates would present working papers on the project, which they claimed were worth RM20 billion. The same group also offered a housing investment project in Kelantan, purportedly leveraging expertise from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, resulting in film producer Datuk Rafiena Ezanee Ramli losing RM1.3 million. Rafiena also reported that the man had deceived her again by pledging a Bentley car, which apparently did not belong to him but to someone else. ""I know that the car was previously used by a female lecturer and does not belong to the man who allegedly deceived me."" On May 20, police said they had completed their investigation and were looking for the suspects, who had gone into hiding."
"[UPDATED] Najib, Irwan Serigar's RM6.6 billion CBT trial postponed for a second time",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 19, 2024 @ 1:57pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court reminded both the prosecution and defence in Datuk Seri Najib Razak and Tan Sri Mohd Irwan Serigar Abdullah's criminal breach of trust (CBT) trial totalling RM6.6 billion to be fully prepared for the hearing next month. Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin made this remark after he was forced to postpone the trial for the second time due to technical issues. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Saifuddin Hashim Musaimi told the court that the prosecution needed to declassify 48 documents that need to be served to the defence team for the trial. He said the prosecution requires at least a month for the documents to be declassified by officials in the relevant agencies before they can be handed over to the defence team. He also mentioned that the defence team had sent an email the day before requesting a postponement of the case. ""The documents requested by the defence include those from the Land Public Transport Agency, the Economic Planning Unit, and cabinet papers. ""Before being marked as exhibits, these documents need to be downgraded as they are classified under the Official Secrets Act (OSA),"" he said. Meanwhile, Irwan's lawyer Datuk Seri K. Kumaraendran confirmed that he had submitted a letter to the prosecution to obtain 48 documents from them. He said most of these documents involve the recorded statements of his client, which will be used in the defence case. Kumaraendran expressed concern that his client's case would be prejudiced without the documents, and thus requested a postponement of the trial until they are received. Najib's lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah echoed Kumaraendran, as his arguments rely on the testimony provided by Irwan. ""We can consider Irwan as the chief executive of the Finance Ministry and he has extensive knowledge of the ministry. ""The documents to be submitted by the prosecution are relevant to my client,"" he said. The court then fixed July 22 for the trial to commence. The judge also reminded all parties that the court no longer wishes to hear excuses regarding documents not being submitted as a reason to postpone trial proceedings. ""Please ensure that all documents related to the case are submitted to the defense before the trial begins. During the proceedings on June 4, the trial could not proceed. ""Today, the trial cannot proceed because the documents were not handed over to the defence. ""I do not want this case to be postponed any further,"" he said. On June 4, the court adjourned the proceeding to give time for both parties to sort out documents that will be used for the trial, ensuring that all necessary evidence is properly organised and presented. Najib and Irwan were charged in October 2018, and had pleaded not guilty to six counts of CBT involving government funds used as payments to the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC). They allegedly committed the offences at the Finance Ministry complex in Putrajaya between Dec 21, 2016 and Dec 18, 2017. The charges, under Section 409 of the Penal Code for CBT by a public servant or agent, carry a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment, caning and a fine upon conviction. The trial will be the fourth of five trials faced by Najib, who has already been found guilty of seven counts of CBT, money laundering, and abuse of power concerning SRC International Sdn Bhd funds."
Police: 13 suspects detained so far in RM24.2 million bank withdrawal syndicate,Austin Camoens,"June 19, 2024 @ 1:47pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Another five suspects have been arrested in Sabah in connection with the syndicate that withdrew RM24.2 million from several savings accounts. Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said until June 18, a total of 13 suspects have been rounded up by police. ""This includes the alleged mastermind, a man in his 40s. ""The 13 suspects comprise eight men and five women.

Yesterday, Ramli said eight suspects have been remanded over the case. He was quoted as saying that the latest three arrests were made on Monday. Last Thursday, a bank employee was arrested on suspicion of being an insider and conspiring with the syndicate to withdraw RM24.2 million from depositors' savings accounts. The department received four reports earlier this month concerning the losses. The complainants, who are account holders and bank staff, reported multiple suspicious cash withdrawals in Kota Kinabalu involving several savings accounts with the bank. The account holders denied any knowledge of the transactions and stated they had not made any withdrawals in Kota Kinabalu as claimed. Investigations so far indicate involvement by syndicate members both inside and outside the bank, as these withdrawals could only have been conducted internally."
Aircraft maintenance company ordered to pay RM1.1 million in unfair dismissal case,New Straits Times,"June 19, 2024 @ 12:05pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Industrial Court awarded approximately RM1.1 million in compensation to a senior manager of an aircraft maintenance company for unfair dismissal. Court chairman Augustine Anthony awarded Fawaid Daud a total of RM1,137,192, comprising RM487,368 in back pay and RM649,824 as compensation for the loss of reinstatement, FMT reported. He said Fawaid, who had been an employee of Airod Sdn Bhd for 32 years, was given a fixed-term annual contract from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2020. ""There is no dispute that the claimant was a permanent employee of the company, having started work on Aug 1, 1988. ""However, he was only offered a fixed-term employment contract on Jan 1, 2000,"" he said in a 58-page award released last week.  Anthony said the company intended to retain Fawaid as a permanent employee. Fawaid had served with an unblemished record and was always willing to be transferred from one department to another. He said that Fawaid had a legitimate expectation to continue working until he reached the mandatory minimum retirement age of 60. He added that while companies and business entities have the full right to operate for profit, they cannot disregard the welfare of their employees. ""The court finds that the company failed to prove on the balance of probabilities that the claimant's dismissal was for a fair reason,"" he said. Although the claimant had not reached the age of 60 at the time of the compensation award, Anthony refused to reinstate him, considering it an unsuitable solution in this case. Fawaid began working with the company in 1988 as an engineer with a salary of RM1,300. He was promoted to deputy manager on July 1, 1993, due to good performance. On Jan 1, 2000, the company appointed Fawaid as general manager on a one-year fixed-term contract, which had been renewed continuously for 20 years since then. After 32 years of service, on Dec 21, 2020, the company issued a service contract termination letter to Fawaid, effective Dec 31, 2020. Fawaid claimed that the dismissal was malicious, illegal, an act of persecution, and an unfair labour practice. According to the company, starting Jan 1, 2000, the claimant was categorised at the management level with a lucrative salary scheme and additional benefits not enjoyed by other permanent employees. The company said according to its policy, all management-level employees would only be offered annual fixed-term contracts. However, Anthony said the evidence did not support the company's argument because the employment contract dated Aug 1, 1988 stated the claimant was employed at the managerial level. Anthony also said a review of the evidence showed that the claimant's remuneration when appointed as general manager was no different from that of the company's permanent employees. Fawaid was represented by lawyer Nur Shazwani Shadan, while Syafiq Amani Sabri represented the company."

A post on Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar's Facebook page stated that the report was presented by RCI chairman, Tun Md Raus Sharif, to His Majesty at Istana Negara today, during an audience lasting nearly an hour. In February, the Legal Affairs Division of the Prime Minister's Department announced that Sultan Ibrahim had consented to the immediate establishment of the commission. The RCI's formation was carried out under the Commissions of Enquiry Act 1950 [Act 119]. On May 23, 2008, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Singapore has sovereignty over Batu Puteh, while Middle Rocks, located less than one kilometre away, belongs to Malaysia. The ICJ also ruled that ownership rights over South Ledge, approximately four kilometres from Batu Puteh, would be determined according to the maritime boundaries of the controlling country. On Feb 2, 2017, Malaysia applied for a review of the ICJ's decision of May 23, 2008. However, in May 2018, the Pakatan Harapan government under Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad withdrew the application just two weeks before the scheduled hearing on June 11, 2018. On Feb 27, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reforms) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said said the establishment of the RCI was aimed at finding a resolution and moving forward with improvements regarding issues involving national sovereignty, rather than assigning blame to any party. She emphasised that Malaysians, especially in Johor, deserve an explanation of the reasons and factors behind the decision not to pursue the Application for Review and Request for Interpretation at the ICJ concerning the sovereignty over Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge. On June 12, Dr. Mahathir provided testimony during the closed-door proceedings of the RCI. – BERNAMA"

"Halim Saad files appeal to revive lawsuit against Mahathir over Renong, UEM share acquisition",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 18, 2024 @ 12:54pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Tycoon Tan Sri Halim Saad has filed an appeal to reinstate his lawsuit against Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and several others over losses he allegedly suffered following the government's acquisition of Renong Bhd and United Engineers Malaysia Bhd (UEM) shares 23 years ago. The 70-year-old businessman is appealing against the High Court's decision to allow Dr Mahathir, former minister Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop, and the government to strike out Halim's suit on May 14. The Appellate Court has scheduled the case management for Sept 9. Judicial Commissioner Dr Suzana Muhamad Said ruled that there was a basis for the limitation of time (statute of limitations). She noted that Halim had filed a similar suit against Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Nor Mohamed, and the government in 2013, which had been disposed of. The issues raised in that case were bound by the principle of res judicata and the limitation of time. ""There is a reason why there is a limitation clause. It is to put a stop to unnecessary actions being taken, especially after a certain period of time. To me, the occasion was in 2001. It has been more than 20 years, and considering the suit filed in 2013, after more than 10 years, only now is this instant case being brought forward to the court,"" she ruled. In 2013, the High Court struck out Halim's suit seeking RM1.8 billion in damages for selling his shares, citing that it was filed beyond the six-year time frame allowed under the Limitation Act 1953. In his statement of claim, Halim contended that the first and second defendants had acted on behalf of the government and were the primary movers in the compulsory acquisition and deprivation in 2001. Halim claimed that complying with Dr Mahathir's directive, as the then prime minister and finance minister, had led him to cede control over Renong and UEM to the government and eventually dispose of his Renong shares at a loss. He argued that this breached his rights under Articles 8 and 13 of the Federal Constitution. Article 8 stipulates that all persons are equal before the law, while Article 13 states that no person shall be deprived of property except in accordance with the law. Halim also claimed that three former members of the UEM board of directors met with the first and second defendants to express their opposition to the government's intervention in the company. They believe that the matter should have been left to the shareholders to decide. Halim asserted that he was not adequately compensated for the UEM acquisition and the deprivation of his rights as a controlling shareholder of Renong. He seeks a court declaration that he was the beneficial and legal owner of Renong shares, not Umno Baru, and that the government was obligated to provide him with adequate compensation as per Article 13 of the Federal Constitution. Additionally, Halim is seeking compensation from the government, as well as exemplary and aggravated damages."

EPF authorised to merge accounts following landmark court ruling [WATCH],Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 18, 2024 @ 12:03pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has been granted the authority to merge accounts belonging to the same individual, the Shah Alam High Court ruled today. In a landmark ruling, Judicial Commissioner Dr Choong Yeow Choy stated that the absence of specific prohibition within the Employees Provident Fund Act 1991 and its regulations allows the EPF to exercise its administrative discretion in merging accounts. The court made this decision in response to a lawsuit filed by M. Divyyaa against the EPF. This legal action was initiated after the EPF merged accounts ending in 236 and 036, which belonged to Divyyaa's late father, S. Machap, into a single account. Machap registered as an EPF member on Aug 1, 1995, under his new identity card number, receiving the account number 036. However, he already held an existing account (number 236) registered under his old identity card on Mar 10, 1984. Despite funds remaining in the older account (236) and none left in the newer one (036), Machap nominated V. K. Dharsyaini as the beneficiary for the 036 account, while leaving no beneficiary for the 236 account. Divyyaa contested the EPF's decision to merge the accounts and its automatic designation of beneficiary.  The plaintiff argued that the EPF lacked the authority to merge the plaintiff's accounts. However, the EPF maintained that it was exercising its administrative discretion in merging the accounts. Additionally, the EPF asserted that the nomination of Dharsyaini as beneficiary complied with all provisions under its Act, Regulations, and Rules. The court noted that while the Employees Provident Fund Act 1991, the Employees Provident Fund Regulations 2001, and the Employees Provident Fund Rules 1991 do not explicitly grant the power to merge accounts, they also do not contain any provisions that prohibit such actions. Furthermore, the court ruled that since the nomination remains valid, Dharsyaini is entitled to the remaining balance in the account. ""This case presents a situation where the outcome will have significant consequences for both claimants, namely the plaintiff and Dharsyaini. ""Regrettably, only one of these claimants will be entitled to the proceeds in the account. ""The defendant has no vested interest in the present suit. Its sole obligation is to fulfil its statutory duties as required,"" the court added."

[UPDATED] Sabah Law Society allowed to proceed with judicial review on Sabah's 40pc revenue entitlement,Ersie Anjumin,"June 18, 2024 @ 10:33am","The Sabah Law Society (SLS) can now proceed with its judicial review in the case concerning the state's entitlement to 40 per cent of federal revenue earned from the state. The Court of Appeal has dismissed the attorney-general's (A-G) appeal against the leave granted for the SLS's judicial review. Court of Appeal justices Datuk Ravinthran N. Paramaguru, Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali and Datuk Dr Choo Kah Sing unanimously dismissed the appeal. The decision was delivered via Zoom today. The appeal was dismissed with no order as to costs. In the decision, the court highlighted two main issues — locus standi and justiciability. On the locus standi, the court said the SLS had, at the very least, established threshold locus standi in the case. ""SLS' judicial review application, based on the discussion in the three previous cases, is clearly a public interest litigation taken for the benefit of a section of the public. ""It is not taken to seek redress for a personal wrong or grievance of the SLS. ""And the issue sought to be addressed in the judicial review application involves a matter of high constitutional importance no less. ""It is taken to purportedly vindicate a constitutional right accorded to the State of Sabah and therefore by extension, for the benefit of the people of Sabah. ""Whether there is merit in this application or otherwise, is a matter that should be addressed in the full hearing. ""It may well be that at the end of the full hearing, the High Court may review the finding of threshold locus standing and may not grant relief on substantive examination of the matter."" On justiciability, the court said at this stage, it cannot be said that the subject matter of the judicial review application is not justiciable. ""Counsel for the SLS pointed out that in the prayers of the judicial review application, the SLS is not challenging the lawfulness of the special grant. ""If that were the case, it would immediately attract the justiciability argument as it is a matter agreed by the federal government and the Sabah government. ""Neither is the SLS asking the court to conduct a review under Article 112D. A prayer to that effect would also attract the justiciability argument as the court is not equipped to handle such a matter. ""The overarching focus of the judicial review application is the alleged omission in the Review Order 2022 to account for the missing 'lost years'. ""The learned High Court judge thought that this is a matter of interpretation to be decided in a full hearing and we find that we cannot disagree with him."" In conclusion, the court said, the two main issues raised by the learned senior federal counsel lack merit given the factual and legal matrix of this unprecedented judicial review application. ""In the premises, we unanimously dismiss the appeal. If this matter is not taken up further by the appellant, we direct the High Court to fix a date for the full hearing of the judicial review application. No order as to costs,"" said Ravinthran. On Nov 11, 2022, the Kota Kinabalu High Court granted SLS leave for its judicial review on the state's entitlement to 40 per cent of federal revenue earned from the state. The A-G appealed the decision and obtained a stay on proceedings in the High Court. On May 24, the Court of Appeal fixed today for the decision. () In a statement, SLS immediate past president Datuk Roger Chin said while the legal journey is still long, the first hurdle of judicial review has been crossed. ""We can now proceed to the substantive hearing. SLS may provide further explanations on the Court of Appeal's decision and outline the steps ahead as the case proceeds through the court's due process, as and when the need arises, for the benefit of the public."""

Memories of late Sri Ram and two other judges relived through reference proceedings,Dawn Chan,"June 14, 2024 @ 7:10pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The late former Federal Court judge and senior deputy public prosecutor Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram will be remembered as a legal giant and a maverick. The memories and contributions of Sri Ram, who died at age 79 on Jan 29 last year, was honoured in a reference proceedings held at the Kuala Lumpur High Court today. Present at the reference was Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat. Attorney General (AG) Datuk Ahmad Terrirudin Mohd Salleh said Sri Ram's death left a vacuum and he will be cherished for his dedication to justice, courage and tenacity. He said Sri Ram's relentless attention to detail and no nonsense approach made him a highly regarded and respected figure in the judiciary and legal fraternity. ""We mourn the passing of an outstanding legal stalwart and the life long champion on the rule of law,"" said Terrirudin. He said they are proud that Sri Ram's last public service was as a senior deputy public prosecutor. He said Sri Ram left the bench as a federal court judge in February 2010 and continued his active practice at the Bar and conducted some high profile cases. ""In 2018, Sri Ram was appointed as a senior deputy public prosecutor by the then A-G to lead the prosecution in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd case. (1MDB) ""Nevertheless, he did not manage to complete the 1MDB case due to his untimely demise,"" he said as the prosecution closed their case in May this year. Terrirudin described Sri Ram as an accomplished legal practitioner all his life from the time he was called to the Bar in 1970. ""He was regarded as a maverick among fellow legal practitioners. As all of us can remember, he was the only judge elevated directly to the Court of Appeal (CoA) from the Bar in 1994. ""My officers remember Sri Ram's quick wit and sharp tongue but he was never condescending and demeaning and blessed with an elephant memory. ""Whether we were standing on the same side or opposing, he treated us with the same respect,"" he said. Malaysian Bar president Mohamad Ezri Abdul Wahab said Sri Ram's elevation from legal practice to the CoA judge spoke volumes of his ability. ""Those who had the privilege of witnessing his legal craft in and out of the court room described him as a champion in all areas of the law. ""His silver tongue and masterful cross examination of witnesses were a thing to behold. ""His name will persist as an emblem of excellence and integrity in the relentless pursuit of justice,"" he said. Presiding judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid said Sri Ram had written 800 judgements and lighted the way for the judiciary. The judge said he would emulate Sri Ram, whose sharp focus had helped saved a lot of judicial time by directing lawyers to the heart of the matter and dwelling only on relevant points. He said he had read the news of Sri Ram's family's donation of his collection of books, journals and law reports estimated at RM9 million to Universiti Malaya's (UM) Faculty of Law. ""This collection is not only useful for law students and practitioners but also those who need to do legal research. ""To me, he was a national treasure.That is his gift and that is very hard to come by,"" he said. Also present at the reference was Sri Ram's wife, Datin Seri Chandra Sri Ram. Two other late High Court judges, Datuk Wan Yahya Pawan Teh and Tan Sri Visu Sinnadurai were also honoured at the reference. Ahmad Kamal said Wan Yahya was the Selangor state legal advisor from 1974 to 1977 when charges were brought against former Menteri Besar Datuk Harun Idris in November 1975. ""One can never imagine the hardships he endured at that time to maintain his neutrality and independence when advising on conflicting legal opinions.""

Also seized during the 7pm raids were computers, 13 mobile phones, eight foreign SIM cards, three ATM cards from various local and international banks, and a car registered to one of the suspects in police custody. Johor Baru (South) police chief Assistant Commissioner Raub Selamat said intelligence gathered following surveillance on the syndicate's operations revealed that the three premises located in the vicinity of the state capital city were converted to illegal call centres to lure victims. The syndicate, believed to be in operations for the past three months targeted locals and foreigners with promises of part-time jobs with monthly salaries ranging between RM3,000 and RM6,500. Raub said the syndicate members aged between 28 and 33 years-old, had used sophisticated methods to perpetuate their fraud. ""Data from the seized computers revealed evidence that the suspects were engaged in deceptive practices related to non-existent part-time job offers. ""Victims were led to believe they could secure high-paying employment, by transferring funds as part of the application process to secure the positions. ""However, when the victims transferred the payments, they were no job opportunities. He said the scammers had allegedly funneled the ill-gotten gains to local and foreign bank accounts. They used numerous online platforms including WhatsApp, to coordinate their fraudulent activities and manage their victim's expectations, extracting as much money as possible. The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating, and the culprits may face a jail term up to ten years, caning, and fines upon conviction. Raub said frequent raids will be conducted from time to time to stop the growing trend of online and phone-based scams. He urged the public to remain vigilant and cautious about job offers that appear too good to be true, especially those requiring upfront payments or personal financial information. Those with information on fraudulent syndicates or illegal calling centres are urged to contact the Johor police hotline at 07-2182222."

Meanwhile, an official spokesperson told the New Straits Times that the defamation suit was related to the dispute on the settlement of Felda's debts between the two and claims that Anwar was paid RM15 million while he was the economic adviser to Selangor. Muhyiddin, who is the Perikatan Nasional (PN) chairman, had in July last year demanded an open and unconditional written apology from Anwar following the latter's claim that Felda settlers' debt totalling RM8.3 billion had never been waived during PN's administration. Muhyiddin insisted he had been responsible for executing a decision in 2021 and accused Anwar of lying to claim credit. Anwar then responded by saying Muhyiddin's administration had only agreed to the debt waiver, but never followed through with it. He also released documents to prove that he was the one who had signed a debt waiver scheme for Felda settlers and demanded an apology from Muhyiddin over the latter's Felda claim. Meanwhile, in December 2022, Anwar filed a defamation suit against Muhyiddin over the latter's statement during a Perikatan Nasional (PN) ceramah, in which he claimed that Anwar had received RM15 million from the Selangor state government as its economic adviser. Anwar in his suit had sought compensation for general and exemplary damages, as well as an injunction to restrain the defendant from further disclosing, composing or publishing similar statements against him."

The ranks were awarded by Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail and was received by both of the late policemen's parents. Both next-of-kin also received ex-gratia and insurance payouts cheques from the government. Meanwhile, Corporal Mohd Hasif Roslan who was critically injured in the incident was promoted to the rank of Sergeant, Lance Corporal Mohd Aznel Mat Salleh to Corporal and Constable Mohd Khairul Azhar Abbi Paisa to Lance Corporal.  Saifuddin said the bravery shown by the policemen was a product of the rigorous training module implemented in Pulapol. ""Our training module will only be known for its quality and the competency it produces when tested with incidents like this. ""The men, at a young age, was already exposed to such incidents and if they had poor police training, merely completing the module, they wouldn't have displayed the character shown during the incident. ""This shows that the module didn't just produce a constable with merely a rank but it develops skills and attitude through a very competent training programme,"" he said. In the 2.54am incident, two policemen were killed and another was seriously injured by a 'lone wolf' attacker, aged 21. The suspect was later shot and killed at the scene. On the status of the detainment of five family members of the suspect under Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma), Saifuddin said it will still remain as announced previously by Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain. ""Detainment under Sosma will allow us to conduct necessary investigations and during this process, they have the option to bring in lawyers. They are permitted to have legal representation. So for now, they remain detained under the act,"" he said."
"MACC investigating 1,000 marriage registrations in Perlis for bribery",Najihah Borhan,"June 14, 2024 @ 5:19pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) is reviewing some 1,000 files of couples who registered their marriages with the Perlis Islamic Religious Affairs Department (JAIPs) as part of investigations into possible bribery cases. Its chief commissioner, Tan Sri Azam Baki, said the move was not to question the intentions of the marriages but to take action against those who have exploited the situation for personal gain. ""What I know is that opening a marriage registration file costs only RM750, but from our investigation, some couples were charged between RM2,500 and RM6,000. ""This is extra money beyond the fees set by the Perlis government. This is one of the things we are investigating,"" he said during a visit to Balai Berita in Bangsar. Azam said the commission is viewing the matter seriously as the issue seems to have been going on for some time. ""They have been operating for a long time and several other states are experiencing the same situation. ""We found similar operations in Perak, and the officers involved have been charged and convicted. So, this issue is now happening in Perlis. ""We will not make it easy for those accepting bribes. We will check how many files have been opened, where the money received was channeled through, and why they chose to do this,"" he added. Previously, it was reported that MACC was investigating bribes taken from Malaysian couples to register their marriage with the Perlis religious authorities after getting married in a neighbouring country. On May 5, the MACC detained a senior officer with JAIPs, an imam, and the latter's son in connection with the case. They have been released on bail pending further investigation on June 13. A source with the MACC said the commission was considering freezing the accounts as investigators are probing the trio for allegedly raking in over RM1 million in kickbacks to register the marriages of Malaysian couples who wed in Thailand between 2022 and last year."

Faithful husband hopeful for missing wife's safe return,Izz Laily Hussein,"June 14, 2024 @ 4:38pm","JOHOR BAHRU: Six months on, a faithful husband waits for his wife, who has been missing since Dec 26 last year, to return to the embrace of their family. Mohd Yusof, 35, remains confident that his wife, Istiqomah Ahmad Rozi, 34, will return safely. According to Mohd Yusof, efforts to find his wife are ongoing, and he has also sought assistance from experts in Islamic medicine. ""I consulted an Islamic medical expert. I was informed that my wife indeed wants to return, but there are obstacles. It's like someone is holding her back. ""I know my wife is still in this country. I sincerely hope that if someone is 'keeping' her or if anyone finds her, they will kindly release her and return her to me and our children,"" he said when contacted. Mohd Yusof said that their eldest child, aged nine, understands that their mother has disappeared and often expresses longing for her. He added that the other two children, aged four and six, still think that their mother, who works as a teacher, has gone to school. Istiqomah has not returned home since Dec 26 and has been unreachable ever since. Mohd Yusof filed a police report immediately after the woman's disappearance, and the next day, her car was found parked at a supermarket near Kota Masai, close to their home. Providing further details, Mohd Yusof said that CCTV footage from the supermarket showed a man exiting the vehicle, but his wif ewas not visible. ""I do not know the man, and he seems to be covering his face, making it difficult to identify him. Strangely, only that man left my wife's car, but my wife was not there,"" he said. Mohd Yusof said that on the day of the incident, he left for work at Pasir Gudang at 6:30 am, and everything at home seemed normal. ""It was school holidays, so my wife didn't work. That morning, I left for work as usual, and my wife and I had no issues. We bid each other goodbye as usual. ""When I returned home at 6pm, my wife wasn't there. She also didn't inform me of her whereabouts. When I asked my child, they said my wife went to school. ""I then looked for her at the school, but the security guard informed me that my wife wasn't there. I sent her a message via WhatsApp, but it didn't reach her. ""For the first three days, she sent messages, but the wording seemed off. After sending a message, her phone seemed to be switched off,"" he said.

Fahmi Abd Moin said he took the matter seriously and would discuss matters with his clients and get their instructions. This comes after the group, Edisi Siasat, had posted what it claims was a record of statements taken by police from Zayn Rayyan's parents, Zaim Ikhwan Zahari and Ismanira Abdul Manaf, in its Telegram group. ""I will discuss further with the family and advise lodging a police report against Edisi Siasat,"" he told the New Straits Times when asked to respond to the alleged leaked documents. Meanwhile, Fahmi also refuted claims from online portals suggesting that he had advised his clients to seek additional police protection.  ""I did not give any statements regarding additional protection, contrary to what has been reported in the portals,"" he said. On a related matter, he said that even though freedom of speech is secured under the Federal Constitution, it must be used wisely and within the scope of laws pertaining to it. The NST has also reached out to the lawyer representing Ismanira, but has yet to receive any response. Earlier, federal Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain had said police would collaborate with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to investigate the dissemination of purported investigation details linked to Zayn Rayyan's murder on social media platforms. He said disseminating unverified information was an extremely irresponsible act and police would ask MCMC to block such posts and messages as they could disrupt the proceedings of the current and any future trials. Yesterday, Zayn Rayyan's parents were jointly charged at the Sessions Court with neglect of their 6-year-old son which may have caused him physical injury last year. Zaim and Ismanira, both 29, pleaded not guilty before judge Dr Syahliza Warnoh.

This was followed by a six-day extension to the remand order, at the end of which the parents were charged."
Azam Baki: MACC identifies over 100 companies in 'flying container' case,Hana Naz Harun,"June 14, 2024 @ 3:41pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has identified more than 100 companies involved in the ""flying container"" syndicate, which has been active and operating for more than a decade in Port Klang. Its chief commissioner, Tan Sri Azam Baki, said these companies acted as ""forwarding agents,"" serving as intermediaries for the payment of bribes to rogue customs officers. The MACC, he said, uncovered the matter following the arrest of 34 customs officers at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport during Op Samba 2.0 and 11 officers at Port Klang during a recent operation. ""We (MACC) are also investigating the finances of these companies, especially the so-called 'forwarding agents'. ""We have also roped in the Customs Department and the Inland Revenue Board since the investigation includes the financial aspects (of the syndicate). ""This process, however, will take some time. We are also using a different approach in investigating these companies compared to the investigation conducted on the officers,"" Azam told reporters during his visit to Balai Berita today. It was reported yesterday that the MACC has arrested 17 people including 11 customs officers to facilitate its investigation into the ""flying container"" case, which resulted in RM3.5 billion in tax leakages. Sources said the MACC has, to date, seized RM4.4 million in cash, believed to be obtained from the proceeds of corruption by the customs officers suspected to be involved in the case. The 'flying container' case came to light following the arrest of seven individuals, including customs personnel last week for suspected collusion with a smuggling syndicate in Port Klang that resulted in tax leakages valued at around RM3.5 billion. A total of 19 containers with various imported products were seized during the operation conducted by the MACC and the Customs Department on June 12."

""These influencers are suspected to have been employed by multiple gambling syndicates for over a year,"" he said.

The sentence was handed down by magistrate Siti Zubaidah Mahat after the accused, M. Malini, 25, pleaded guilty to the charge. Siti Zubaidah ordered the accused to serve the jail term from the date of her arrest. According to the charge sheet, Malini was accused of intentionally causing injuries to the boy by hitting him on the cheek and back. The incident occurred at a kindergarten on Jalan Pandamaran near here at 9.36am on May 13. The charge was framed under Section 323 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum penalty of one year jail or a fine of RM2,000 or both. The accused was initially unrepresented by a lawyer. During mitigation, she requested the court to impose a minimum fine as she was from a B40 family and had repented for her mistake. ""I am the eldest child and support my family with a monthly salary of RM1,700. I apologise for slapping (the victim),"" she said. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Yong Ching Hong requested a deterrent sentence. Yong said the accused being a kindergarten teacher should show affection and not resort to hitting children. ""The situation has caused trauma to the victim."" However, after the sentence was passed, the accused returned to the courtroom for further proceedings after appointing lawyer A. Birantha to seek permission to suspend execution of the sentence until her appeal was later decided in the High Court. Birantha said Malini did not receive advice regarding today's proceedings. She was informed by her family that she would only have to pay a fine. ""This morning, I believe no one represented the accused. My client also just got married last April and is taking care of her parents,"" she said. The prosecution did not object to the request and urged the court to impose bail of RM5,000 with one surety. The magistrate allowed the accused's application and set bail of RM5,000. It was previously reported that a 4-year-old boy was reported to have sustained injuries after he was allegedly hit by his teacher at a kindergarten in Pandamaran here on May 13. Police investigation revealed that the victim had soiled his pants while at the kindergarten. The teacher then instructed the child to go to the bathroom. However, when the child refused to get up from his chair, the teacher allegedly slapped the child."

Seremban High Court judicial commissioner Mohamad Haldar Abdul Aziz made the ruling on the grounds that the civil courts have no power to hear such matters, as they fall under the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. He said the applicant's action of filing an originating summons in the civil court against the Negri Sembilan Islamic Religious Council (Mains), the National Registration Department (NRD) and the government constitutes an abuse of the court process. ""The Federal Court has ruled that any application for the declaration of renunciation from Islam falls within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court. ""Article 121(1A) of the Federal Constitution has clarified the jurisdictional separation between the civil court and the Syariah Court, stating that each court is only permitted to hear and decide cases within its respective jurisdictions. ""Therefore, when a law clearly falls under the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court, any civil High Court does not have jurisdiction to hear it, whether through civil applications or judicial reviews,"" he said in his grounds of judgment dated yesterday. The applicant in her lawsuit asserted that she never recited the shahada (declaration of faith) and has never practiced the religion throughout her life. She claimed to have been raised by a maternal aunt since the age of 4 and has never practiced the Islamic way of life. The applicant claimed she was born Hindu and has consistently practiced and adhered to Hinduism throughout her life. Despite the applicant's claim to have previously applied for a declaration of non-Muslim status in the Negri Sembilan Syariah Court, there is currently no evidence to support this assertion, and it has been refuted by the Negri Sembilan Syariah Judiciary Department chief registrar. The applicant is appealing the decision."

Shuhaily insisted that the investigation involving Zayn Rayyan's case according to Section 302 of the Penal Code had been completed. He, however, did not rule out continuing the investigation according to the section if there was a need for a trial. ""As I said yesterday, the investigation under Section 302 of the Penal Code has ended with the charge made under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act. ""However, should there be revelations (further evidence) that lead to Section 302 of the Penal Code during the trial, the deputy public prosecutor can instruct us and we will investigate again (according to Section 302 of the Penal Code),"" he said. Shuhaily said this when asked to comment on the statement by lawyer Fahmi Abd Moin, who yesterday said that investigations into the tragic murder of Zayn Rayyan would continue. This is despite the parents being charged under the Child Act. Earlier, the parents of the autistic boy were charged at the Sessions Court with neglect of their 6-year-old son which may have caused him physical injuries last year. The couple Zaim Ikhwan Zahari and Ismanira Abdul Manaf, both aged 29, said they understood the charge and pleaded not guilty before judge Dr Syahliza Warnoh. The charge read that they had, as persons having the care of Zayn Rayyan, neglected him in a manner likely to cause him physical injury. They committed the offence from 12pm on Dec 5 until about 9.55pm on Dec 6 around the area of Jalan PJU 10/1 in Damansara Damai.

The film's director Mohd Khairianwar Jailani, 32, and its producer Tan Meng Kheng, 37, sought to refer the matter to determine whether Section 298 of the Penal Code violates Article 10 of the Federal Constitution, which protects freedom of speech. They also requested that the High Court determine whether the phrase ""hurting the religious feelings of a person"", which pertains to the elements of the offence under that section, violates the right to a fair trial due to its vagueness and ambiguity. Magistrate Noorelynna Hanim Abd Halim granted the application after finding that it (application) had merit. She said the court made this determination after thoroughly reviewing the entire application, including the notice of motion filed on March 11 and the written as well as oral submissions presented by both parties on May 10. The court also postponed the case pending the decision by the High Court. She also fixed Sept 20 for next mention. Lawyer Zaid Malek appeared for both applications while deputy public prosecutor Abdul Malikakwa Raya Abdul Malik Ayob and Nadia Mohd Azhar represented the Attorney-General's Chambers. On Jan 17, Khairianwar and Tan pleaded not guilty to deliberately intending to wound the religious feelings of others in their roles as producer, director, and scriptwriters of ""Mentega Terbang"", a movie that delves into the theology of major religions. The charge, framed under Section 298 of the Penal Code, carries a jail sentence of up to one year or a fine or both. In March 2023, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said it contacted Hong Kong-based video streaming company, Viu, to remove ""Mentega Terbang"" from the platform. According to the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (Jakim), the contents of the indie movie go against the creed and way of life of Muslims from the Syafie school of thought in Malaysia."

According to sources, initial investigations revealed that the syndicate operates more than 10 forwarding companies used to smuggle imported goods by making false tax declarations.

"(UPDATED) Anwar's speech referred to addendum order on house arrest, claims Najib",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 5, 2024 @ 1:37pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Najib Razak claims that the speech by Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during the recent PKR special convention is the strongest evidence of the addendum order by the former King allowing him to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. The incarcerated former prime minister made this contention in his latest affidavit to support his judicial review application to compel the government to produce the addendum dated Jan 29. He also included footage of Anwar's speech together with the transcript which was held at Ideal Convention Centre (IDCC) in Shah Alam on April 21. Najib claimed Anwar, who is the prime minister, in his speech did not mention the main order but subtly questioned the validity of the addendum order without explicitly naming it. Najib asserted that the Tambun member of parliament referred to an affidavit that was filed by his deputy Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi to support Najib's judicial review application.  The Umno president had claimed that Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz showed him a copy of the addendum order on his phone on Jan 30, which he personally photographed or scanned from an original copy as shown to him by the former King. Najib claimed the prime minister in his speech said the validity of this ""order"" (without specifically naming it) was questionable as it was not discussed during the Pardons Board meeting when the King was in charge. ""It is clear from the speech that Anwar was erroneously advised by the Attorney-General that such an order could not have been valid unless specifically discussed and advised during the Pardons Board proceedings. ""Most importantly, the speech strengthens my counsel's argument that if the prime minister found it appropriate to avoid discussing the legality of such an addendum order, why not simply deny its existence if it truly did not exist? ""Thus, the prime minister tacitly acknowledged the existence of the addendum order,"" claimed Najib. On April 21, Anwar in his speech said any decision regarding the alleged addendum order granting house arrest to Najib must be made in the meeting of the Pardons Board. Anwar added he would not interfere in the matter, despite being criticised for doing nothing. On Jan 29, the Federal Territories Pardons Board, which the then King presided over, halved Najib's 12-year jail sentence for abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in the SRC International case, and reduced his RM210 million fine to RM50 million. Najib in his judicial review application to the High Court on April 1, claimed the then King issued an addendum order — also on Jan 29 — allowing him to serve the remainder of his jail sentence under house arrest. He named the Home Minister, Prison Department commissioner general, Attorney-General (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents."

Muhammad Faisal Hamzah,40, claimed trial to the offence before judge Rozina Ayob. ""I plead not guilty,"" he said. The charge sheet read that he had dishonestly accepted the bribes from Izmir Abd Hamid as inducement for Heitech Padu Berhad to appoint Rimba Merpati Sdn Bhd and Syarikat Per My Solutions as marketing consultant because of his influence.

In mitigation, Faisal's counsel Ravinder Singh Dhalliwal pleaded for bail to be set at RM25,000 for his client, who is a father of four. He said his client needed to travel to Thailand monthly as he was in the process of opening a hostel. In reply, Mahadi said the RM30,000 proposed bail sum was appropriate as the bribe sum stated on the charge was RM100,000. ""We should take into consideration the nature of this charge and the background of the accused. ""The accused does not have dire financial issues and he is also the son of a former senior minister. ""We maintain our stance on his passport because as practiced in MACC cases, an accused can apply for temporary release of passport if he wants to go overseas. ""We will study each application whether to object or otherwise,"" he said. Judge Rozina set bail at RM25,000 with one surety and allowed the prosecution's applications. She also ruled that Faisal is blacklisted from travelling overseas."

"Kuantan carjacking horror: Brave grandma threw handbag out, grabbed hold of daughter's bag",T.n. Alagesh,"June 4, 2024 @ 7:21pm","KUANTAN: Retiree Napisah Muhammad put on a brave front and attempted to fight back while being taken on a terrifying ride following a carjacking incident at a petrol station in Semambu, near here, yesterday. The 68-year-old was carjacked by a lone suspect after her daughter left the Honda City's engine running. The mother of two endured a 400m ride before the suspect dropped her off along the road shoulder and sped off. Napisah, a retired teacher, said the daring daylight car theft happened within seconds after she stepped into the vehicle about 3.10pm after returning from the restroom. ""My husband had gone to the restroom and barely seconds after my daughter stepped out of the driver's seat towards the toilet, a stranger entered. He held my shoulder tight and kept on saying 'kau diam' (keep quiet). ""I knew something was not right and opened my door. I screamed for help and managed to throw my handbag on the floor outside the car. As the man drove off, I did not close my door and attempted to jump out of the moving vehicle. ""I put up a struggle and tried to jump out of the moving car when one of my slippers dropped on the road. ""When the man realised that I was turning aggressive, he slowed down the car and pushed me out shouting 'kau nak keluar, kau berambus' (you want to go out, you get lost)... before stepping out, I managed to grab my daughter's handbag,"" she said when contacted today. Napisah, who was travelling with her 77-year-old husband and 38-year-old daughter, said several motorists who realised something amiss had been honking non-stop asking the man to stop and one of them even gave chase for a while, but the man managed to sped away. Napisah said when the man drove off from the petrol station, she kept calling out for her daughter Norharlina Mohamed, who had attempted to chase the car on foot. ""When the man dropped me by the roadside, my daughter came to my aid. I am a little shaken by the entire incident and I was informed that the man was not alone during the incident. ""I believe that the man had been watching our movements since my family arrived at the premises and my daughter even crossed paths with him when she was walking towards the toilet. ""The incident serves as a reminder to my family and others to always press the car central lock when seated inside the vehicle. Such incidents can happen anywhere so it is best to be a little extra careful especially those with young children,"" she said, adding that she was relieved to escape unhurt in the incident. Napisah, who lives in Kuala Lumpur, said they had just dropped her grandson at the Mara Junior College (MRSM) here and had stopped at the petrol station to refuel before travelling home. ""Each time we travel here to send my grandson to the MRSM, we will stop at the same petrol station. It will usually be our last stop before entering the highway,"" she said. Meanwhile Napisah said the man had discarded most of their belongings kept inside the car at various locations including near Sungai Isap here. ""Our bags, clothes and door gifts that we received at a 'kenduri' event yesterday were found strewn by the road side near Taman Cempaka and Sungai Isap. I am keeping my fingers crossed that the stolen car will be found soon,"" she said, adding they were currently staying with a relative here. In the 3.10pm incident yesterday, the man who arrived at a petrol station on a stolen motorcycle coolly drove off with a red Honda City with Napisah seated inside."
Two Customs enforcement assistants claim trial to bribery charges,Bernama,"June 4, 2024 @ 4:50pm","KUALA TERENGGANU: Two enforcement assistants from the Royal Malaysian Customs Department were charged at the Sessions Court here today, with accepting bribes totalling RM12,500 between December 2017 and April last year. Che Mohd Taufik Che Arif, 33, and Mohd Afiq Ikhwan Ramli, 30, pleaded not guilty to the charges read out before Judge Mohd Azhar Othman. According to the charges, Che Mohd Taufik faces 13 counts of receiving RM9,000 in bribes from J. Jehatis, the owner of Kalos Enterprise, as an inducement not to inspect the company's trucks transporting goods from the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) cargo terminal, while Mohd Afiq faces a single count of receiving a RM3,500 bribe for the same offence. The bribes were allegedly received through online transfers from Jehatis to their respective accounts at Maybank's Jertih branch in Besut. Both accused were charged under Section 17(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a fine of at least five times the amount of the bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction. Deputy public prosecutor Maziah Mohaide proposed bail at RM20,000 for Che Mohd Taufik and RM10,000 for Mohd Afiq, along with additional conditions of surrendering their passports, monthly reporting to the nearest MACC office, and refraining from contacting prosecution witnesses until the case is concluded. She also requested that both accused, who are still serving at KLIA, be denied access to Customs data and information during the relevant period. Their lawyer Ridha Abdah Subri, however, requested lower bails, citing his clients' financial constraints and asserting that they did not pose a flight risk. Judge Mohd Azhar Othman set bail at RM16,000 for Che Mohd Taufik and RM5,000 for Mohd Afiq, with one surety each and agreed to the additional conditions. The case management date was set for July 18. Earlier, MACC had announced plans to charge 23 Customs officers and personnel, detained during Op Samba 2.0, in sessions courts nationwide by this Thursday. The operation, conducted from March 11 to 25, focused on investigating the Customs personnel working in the KLIA cargo division, ultimately uncovering a tax revenue loss of RM2 billion. – BERNAMA"

Court rules Rewcastle-Brown disrespected royal institution when defaming Terengganu Sultanah,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"June 4, 2024 @ 2:03pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Sarawak Report editor Clare Rewcastle-Brown's defamatory statements about the Sultanah of Terengganu, Sultanah Nur Zahirah, in her book about 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), were disrespectful to country's royal institution. Terengganu magistrate Nik Mohd Tarmizie Nik Mohd Shukri said Rewcastle-Brown's action created a negative perception of Sultanah Nur Zahirah and damaged her good name and reputation. He said this in his judgment when sentencing the 65-year-old editor to two years after finding her guilty of defaming Sultanah Nur Zahirah in her book, 'The Sarawak Report – The Inside Story of the 1MDB Exposé'. ""After considering the testimonies provided by the prosecution witnesses, the court is convinced that the slanderous remarks directed at the Sultanah of Terengganu constitute defamation that could tarnish her reputation and good name. ""The slanderous remarks directly implicated the involvement of the Sultanah of Terengganu with fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho or Jho Low, who is suspected of being involved in the 1MDB scandal. ""This indirectly tarnishes the reputation of the Sultanah of Terengganu in the country's largest scandal,"" he said in the judgment dated June 2. He said the royal institution holds a special and highest position in the Constitution and is highly regarded by the people. ""As the trial was conducted in absentia under Section 425A of the Criminal Procedure Code, the court had no alternative, and thus finds the accused guilty and convicts her under Section 500 of the Penal Code from the date of conviction (Feb 7)."" He said the defendant's failure to respect the Malaysian legal system by choosing to waive her right to attend the trial was also taken into consideration by the court in imposing the maximum sentence. According to the charges, Rewcastle-Brown, who has a London address in the United Kingdom, wrote a book titled ""The Sarawak Report - The Inside Story of 1MDB Expose"" which contains accusations against the Sultanah of Terengganu. The specific defamatory content, highlighted on page three, paragraph four, and line seven, was the phrase ""the wife of the Sultan,"" which was deemed a deliberate act aimed at tarnishing the reputation of Sultanah Nur Zahirah. She was charged with committing the offence at 8 am, Sept 14, 2018, at Lot 60048, Taman Chendering Utama here."

The post included a screenshot of a Malay daily Sinar Harian article dated Jan 28, 2019, featuring the plaintiff's face. Dzulkefly asserted that the statement implied, among other things, that he practised cronyism by offering positions or appointments to relatives without any objective evaluation or assessment of their suitability for government positions.

Man found drowned 5 days after jumping into Sungai Pahang to escape police,T.n. Alagesh,"June 4, 2024 @ 1:50pm","KUANTAN: An angler who dived into Sungai Pahang during a police raid at a floating raft house in Kampung Serendang near Charuk Puting in Bera on May 28 was found drowned on Sunday. The 25-year-old's body was found at 11am 5km from the spot where he was last seen. Pahang police chief Datuk Seri Yahaya Othman said investigations revealed the man had jumped into the river to flee from police who were conducting an anti-drug operation codenamed Op Hawk in the area. ""During the police operation, the victim had jumped into the river. A search operation was started, before his remains were recovered several days later on June 2,"" he told reporters after attending the Pahang police monthly gathering at the state police headquarters here. Yahaya said the man's father had lodged a police report on May 29 after his son failed to return home after going fishing about 8.30pm the previous day. The victim's father told police that his son's friend informed him that the Bera Narcotics Crime Investigation Department had raided the floating raft house about 10pm on May 28 and the victim dived into the water. The three-day Op Hawk conducted across Pahang last week led to the arrest of 226 people, including 11 women, aged between 16 and 64 for various drug offences. On a separate matter, Yahaya said police were in the midst of compiling the psychiatric assessment report on the 35-year-old woman who stopped her vehicle along the East Coast Expressway 1 near Temerloh before crossing the stretch, resulting in a fatal accident on April 26. ""The woman was instructed to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at a hospital before she was released on police bail. We will compile the necessary documents including the hospital report before sending it to the deputy public prosecutor's office for further action,"" he said. In the April 26 incident, a 34-year-old man died when his high-powered motorcycle collided with a Mitsubishi Triton four-wheel-drive vehicle. The Triton which was on the fast lane had come to a halt to avoid the woman who ran across the road. In his speech earlier, Yahaya said the Pahang Commercial Crime Investigation Department had opened 869 investigation papers into cases involving losses of RM42 million in the first five months of this year. He said even though the number of cases was lower compared to the same duration last year which recorded 932 cases, the total loss recorded last year was only RM18 million."

Sessions Court judge Suzana Hussin today set a 15-day trial after deputy public prosecutor Mahadi Abdul Jumaat said the prosecution and defence had discussed and agreed to the dates. The court has scheduled the following dates for the hearings: Sept 10 and 11, Oct 29 and 30, Nov 6 and 7, Dec 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12, as well as Jan 7, 8, and 9 next year. About 15 prosecution witnesses will testify in the trial. Hamid's counsel Weera Premananda confirmed the matter. On April 5 last year, Hamid was charged with offering RM500,000 per year for 15 years to Datuk Tan Ser Lay, 60, for the benefit of the then communications and multimedia minister, Tan Sri Annuar Musa, at the ministry's headquarters between July and August in 2022. The money was an inducement to approve the acquisition of Menara KL by the accused's company. In another court, Hydroshoppe was charged with the same offence involving the same individuals. Hamid, who appeared on behalf of the company, also pleaded not guilty to the offence. On Jan 7 last year, two senior directors of a company were remanded in custody for four days to assist in the investigation. The two individuals with the title ""Datuk"" were the managing director of the company that was allegedly involved in taking over Menara KL and a businessman who is believed to be the ""middleman"" in the acquisition. A Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission probe had allegedly found that kickbacks — hundreds of thousands of ringgit and a luxury watch — exchanged hands in the acquisition. Annuar, however, shot down claims he was involved in the approval of the tender. "

The couple, in their 20s, who tested positive for drugs, also had their car seized and were remanded for one day. Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said they received the report on the case yesterday.

Senior customs officer charged with not handing over pangolin scales to Perhilitan,Bernama,"May 31, 2024 @ 4:43pm","SHAH ALAM: A senior Customs Department (Customs) officer was charged at the Sessions Court here today for not handing over seized pangolin scales to the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (Perhilitan) in 2019. Ahmad Hilmi Ghazali, 51, pleaded not guilty to the charges under Section 403 of the Penal Code read to him in front of Judge Awang Kerisnada Awang Mahmud. He is alleged to have instructed a senior Customs assistant superintendent to dispose of the scales of a pangolin of the Genus Manis SPP species, which were seized items, from the Enforcement Sore of the North Klang Port Marine Base between September and December 2019 even though he knew that they needed to be handed over to Perhilitan as the managing authorities appointed under Section 6(1) of the International Trade in Endangered Species Act 2008 . Deputy public prosecutor Wan Azreen Wan Zaid suggested bail to be set between RM30,000 and RM50,000 with the condition that the accused hand over his passport and report to the nearest Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) office for the duration of the case, as the value of the case items could reach several million on the black market. Ahmad Hilmi's counsel, Nor Azri Mohd Arif requested that the court impose a non-punitive bail as the accused had high commitments and was supporting two wives and four young children. The court subsequently set bail at RM20,000 with one surety and the condition that the accused would need to report in at the Penang MACC office monthly and not contact or disturb any prosecution witness.

Court orders Osram Opto to pay ex-staff RM1.5 million for unjust dismissal,,No published date found,"PUTRAJAYA: Semiconductor giant Osram Opto Semiconductors Sdn Bhd (Osram) was ordered to pay more than RM1.5 million to its former senior officer for unjustified retrenchment nine years ago. In a unanimous decision, a three-member bench of the Court of Appeal, presided over by Judge Datuk Lee Swee Seng, granted the award to 57-year-old Ooi Mei Chein @ Wei Mei Chein, who was simultaneously contending with the challenges of divorce proceedings and the complexities of child custody and maintenance. Other members of the bench were Datuk Supang Lian and Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim. The court awarded compensation in lieu of reinstatement of RM804,650 and back wages of RM772,464 to the company's former Treasury and Commercial Administration Services head who earned RM32,186 per month at the time of her termination. Ooi, who had served with the company for 24 years, was laid off when the company opted to outsource its accounting and treasury functions to a Global Shared Services Organisation (GSS), rendering Ooi's position redundant. However, Ooi argued that her services remained indispensable, emphasising that while some functions were absorbed by the GSS, 19 functions and 15 of her roles remained unchanged, highlighting the ongoing relevance and necessity of her contributions to the company. The court said the retrenchment exercise must be conducted genuinely, without any bad faith, ensuring it is not undertaken for collateral purposes like cost-cutting measures or corporate restructuring under the guise of focusing on core business. ""It must not be done for the purpose of getting rid of perceived stumbling blocks in old timers who may well have passed their prime to give way to young Turks who perhaps, oblivious to the risks ahead, are prepared to venture afar and 'to boldly go where no one has gone before', to borrow the famous split infinitive from Star Trek. ""For some people facing life's challenges, it never rains but pours, and for her it was battling both the uncertainty of being unemployed and the adjustment of being a single parent to two children, coping with the issues of custody, access and maintenance that flow from a divorce. ""The retrenchment exercise rendering the respondent (Ooi) redundant was not carried out bona fide (in good faith) but was undertaken for an oblique and collateral purpose of getting rid of her for reasons best known to it,"" said the court. The court said it was apparent that there has been a breakdown in the essential mutual trust and confidence among key staff, particularly at the director level, which is necessary for confidential discussions. The court said Ooi stated that she could no longer trust her superiors and colleagues, alleging that she was lied to and deceived by them, leading up to her termination. ""One cannot always be looking over one's shoulder to see if anyone has a dagger. ""Confidence, once broken, cannot be restored and while time may have its healing properties, it is a luxury that most companies can ill-afford. ""Having to work with people that one no longer can trust would be stressful and unhealthy, psychologically speaking. ""We hear what the respondent is saying in that she needs to work to feel fulfilled and fruitful as a productive person,"" said the court. The court said given the complexity and evolving nature of the factors involved, awarding compensation rather than reinstatement is appropriate in this case. The court also awarded costs of RM15,000 to be paid by the company."
"Husband pleads guilty, wife claims trial for stealing ice cream and alcohol",Dawn Chan,"May 31, 2024 @ 3:42pm","PETALING JAYA: A couple was jointly charged at the magistrate's court today with stealing 13 types of food and drinks worth RM556 from a supermarket in Ara Damansara last week.

However, Ravintheran made his guilty plea while Christina claimed trial to the charge. He was served with a one-day jail sentence and a RM3,000 fine in default two months jail. They were charged with stealing 13 items consisting of alcohol, fruit juices, energy drinks, flavoured milk and ice cream from the supermarket in a condominium building at about 1.22am on May 22. The offence under Section 380 of the Penal Code, read with Section 34, provides a maximum 10-year jail term and fine. Ravintheran admitted to the facts of the case, which stated that a closed-circuit television camera (CCTV) recording showed he and three others had entered the premises and took several items but did not pay for them. The complainant was told by a member of staff that there were fewer alcoholic beverages in stock, but no record of payment was received. Checks by the supermarket staff revealed the items had gone missing, and they subsequently made a police report. Investigations showed the couple had committed theft in a dwelling house. In mitigation, Ravintheran, who was unrepresented, said he should be blamed. ""I was drunk and unaware of my actions. I took the items and put them in my wife's bag. ""My wife is not in the wrong. She admitted to the offence just because she wanted to save me. ""I stole the items,"" he pleaded. He said his wife, who has diabetes, had recently undergone surgery and needed dressing daily, on top of caring for their two children and his sickly mother. Deputy public prosecutor Asmaa' Zamri asked the court to impose a RM5,000 bail on Christina. Christina said that her husband was sacked from his job because of the incident. ""Now we have no income, and I'm asking for a lesser bail sum. ""I am in charge of sending our children to school, and now, they are waiting outside,"" she said. The court set RM2,800 with one surety and July 30 for document submission and the appointment of counsel."

The former Bank Negara Malaysia governor said this during re-examination by deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib in Datuk Seri Najib Razak's corruption trial for misappropriating billions of 1MDB funds before a High Court today. Earlier, Akram told Zeti that Ashok had given a different version from what she had been telling the court about their meeting to discuss the opening of Najib's bank account at Ambank. Ashok, in his statement, said he sent several letters to Zeti to update her about funds entering the former prime minister's account allegedly from Saudi Arabia, which Zeti vehemently denied. Akram: To your knowledge, is there any reason he (Ashok) wants to do this? Zeti: Yes. He wanted to cover up his wrongdoing during his time as Ambank chief executive officer. It (the wrongdoing) starts from the very beginning. Zeti, who is a key witness in the trial, said Ambank failed to exercise due diligence before releasing the funds. ""In the case of other financial institutions, they did due diligence and that is when they found out that the funds went into Good Star Ltd. ""That is why they got a letter from former 1MDB chief executive Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi,"" she said.

According to a source, the suspect, an officer, was arrested mid last year by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission's Anti-Money Laundering Division as part of a special operation codenamed Op Jaguar. The source said the suspect, in his 50s, was alleged to have accepted  bribes from the syndicate as inducement not to handover the seized pangolin scales to the Wildlife Department. ""The suspect is believed to have withheld approximately 1.8 tonnes of confiscated pangolin scales, seized by Customs, from the department for disposal. ""The acts were allegedly committed between September and December 2019 at the Klang North Port marine enforcement base storage,"" said the source. It was reported that the pangolin scales were believed to have been smuggled into the country which is the transit point before being sent to China and other countries with high demand. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime had stated that Malaysia was a source country and transit point in the trafficking and smuggling of endangered wildlife like tiger, pangolin, elephant tusk and turtles. Op Jaguar conducted mid last year in Klang, Selangor and Kuala Lumpur saw MACC's seizure of close to two tonnes of pangolin scales, valued at RM23.4 million, which was estimated sales can reach RM13,000 per kg in the black market. The operations, conducted based on information from enforcement agencies from the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, crippled the syndicate which was believed to have also bribed enforcement officers and involved in money laundering activities. In the operations, MACC also seized various luxury cars and froze several bank accounts with millions of ringgit believed to be owned by the syndicate.

1MDB trial: Najib kept millions allegedly received from Saudi monarch after GE13 as contingency plan,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 30, 2024 @ 3:11pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak kept millions of funds he allegedly received from a Saudi monarch as a contingency plan after the 13th General Election in 2013, the High Court heard today. Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) senior officer Nur Aida Arifin said Najib told her this during investigations into his alleged misappropriation of billions from 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) funds. Nur Aida, who is the investigating officer of the case said Najib informed her that the funds were reserved for 'exceptional circumstances', such as the incident on Sept 16, 2008, where Barisan Nasional (BN) candidates were subjected to 'party hopping' as the opposition endeavored to purchase their allegiance. ""Najib said despite his disagreement with the practice, he felt compelled to be financially prepared out of concern that the opposition might try it again. ""However, he felt necessary and decided to return the funds into an entity appointed by the Saudi's government – Tanore Finance Crop. after no such movement occurred,"" she said. Nur Aida said this when testifying in Najib's corruption trial for misappropriating billions of 1MDB funds before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah today. She said Najib opted to return the funds as they were no longer necessary for election expenses or any contingency spending as mentioned earlier. ""He was concerned that keeping such a substantial amount in his account could invite various perceptions if it were to leak. ""He claimed he did not know who the real owner or beneficiary owner of Tanore and assumed it owned by the government of Saudi Arabia and its representatives,"" she said. Najib, 70, is facing four charges of using his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.3 billion from 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount. Hearing before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues."
Hearing of Clare Rewcastle-Brown's appeal postponed due to technical issues,,"May 30, 2024 @ 1:56pm","PUTRAJAYA: The court hearing for Sarawak Report editor Clare Rewcastle-Brown's appeal against a defamation suit filed by Sultanah of Terengganu, Sultanah Nur Zahirah, has been postponed. The delay occurred because her lead counsel, Americk Singh Sidhu, was unable to attend the proceeding via Zoom due to technical issues. The editor is seeking a leave (permission) from the Federal Court to dismiss the Court of Appeal's ruling, which found her and two others liable for defaming the Sultanah Nur Zahirah in her book, ""The Sarawak Report – The Inside Story of the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) Exposé."" The Appellate Court also awarded RM300,000 in damages to Sultanah Nur Zahirah. In today's proceedings, a three-member Apex Court bench led by Tan Sri Nallini Pathmanathan adjourned the hearing after Americk's audio began to break up. The judge said the court would fix a new date for case management. Other members of the bench were Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil. On Dec 12, last year, the Court of Appeal overturned the lower court decision, which had dismissed Sultanah Nur Zahirah's RM100 million lawsuit against the editor. The Appellate Court said it had considered several factors in providing compensation including a lack of remorse by Rewcastle-Brown. ""Rewcastle-Brown acknowledged that she had made an error in the book but declined to mention those errors during interviews with news portal Free Malaysia Today and Sarawak Report on Sept 18 and 27, 2018, respectively. ""The defendant (Rewcastle-Brown) also did not apologise to the plaintiff (Sultanah Nur Zahirah) at any time before the legal action was taken. ""In conclusion, the High Court clearly erred in dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit,"" the court said. The court said the image of Sultanah Nur Zahirah was badly tainted when she was linked with the fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho or Jho Low in the book. ""The editor also failed to show that the impugned statement was true."" The court also awarded costs of RM120,000 to be paid by the respondents. Apart from Rewcastle-Brown, the Sultanah also named book publisher Gerakbudaya Enterprise and printer Vinlin Press Sdn Bhd as the other defendants. Sultanah Nur Zahirah claimed RM100 million in damages from each of the defendants and wanted the second defendant, the publisher, to withdraw the books containing the defamatory statements as well as to stop the third defendant, the printing company, from printing more copies of the book. In their statement of defence, the three defendants denied that they had accused Sultanah Nur Zahirah of being involved in corrupt practices. Rewcastle-Brown contended that Sarawak Report did not suggest that the Sultanah was involved in a conspiracy that involved Low or that she was involved in the government administration associated with 1MDB matters."

"Continue probe into VVIP's bodyguard over alleged assault, cops told [NSTTV]",New Straits Times,"May 30, 2024 @ 11:17am","KUALA LUMPUR: The police have been urged to continue probing the alleged assault of a deaf-mute e-hailing driver by a VVIP's bodyguard. This comes after the disabled man lodged second a report stating that the matter had been resolved and that he did not want to prolong the matter. Earlier, Bukit Aman police criminal investigation department director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain confirmed the cops were probing the alleged assault. This followed the driver's first police report on the incident. ""We remind the authorities that there is no such thing as a 'settlement' of a criminal case between the perpetrator and victim of any incident involving a criminal act,"" said Lawyers for Liberty director Zaid Malek. ""Once the police receive information regarding commission of an offence, they are duty-bound to investigate the matter,"" he said jn a statement. Zaid said Section 3(3) of the Police Act 1967 requires the police to preserve peace and security, prevent and detect crime, and apprehend and prosecute offenders. ""This duty cannot be disregarded simply because a police report was filed settling or retracting the initial report of the crime. ""If this was allowed, then those in power can exert it to coerce any report filed against them to be retracted."" Zaid said such a situation would lead to the ""breakdown"" of the country's criminal justice system. He said Article 8 of the Federal Constitution provided for equality before the law and that no one can escape justice regardless of status or their connections. ""We demand that the police continue its investigation on this matter,"" Zaid said, adding the case involved public interest. Yesterday, in a police report that has since gone viral, the victim claimed to have been punched by the bodyguard of a member of a royal family after he was asked to move his car while waiting at the lobby of a five-star hotel at KL Sentral."

Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) senior officer Nur Aida Arifin made this contention while testifying in the Datuk Seri Najib Razak corruption trial, which concerns the misappropriation of billions of ringgit from the sovereign wealth fund. She was cross-examined by Najib's lawyer, Wan Azwan Aiman Wan Fakhruddin, who suggested that 1MDB's investments in various sectors were profitable.

She said 1MDB had to seek separate investments by attracting other companies to invest in the development of TRX. ""Further investigation revealed that the funds obtained for the development of TRX, formerly known as Kuala Lumpur International Financial District (KLIFD), had been misappropriated.

A three-man panel led by judge Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal unanimously rejected the review application of Shahril, the son of a jewellery businessman with the title of ""Datuk"". Judge Harmindar said the application was dismissed and the death sentence maintained. ""The court is always alive to compassion and mercy. ""But this was an exceptional case with exceptional facts.The victim of the murder suffered with exceptional violence. ""She was raped, sodomised, tortured and then killed. The killing had alarmed the public and caused public uproar. ""This murder had shocked the conscience of the public as it took place in broad daylight and in a place supposedly safe. ""Although the court is not bound by or disregard the public opinion, we cannot also ignore it. Therefore, this application is denied, and the death sentence is upheld,"" he said. Also on the panel were judges Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. They had heard Shahril's review application made under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. On Aug 9,2015, the Alor Star High Court sentenced Shahril to death after he was found guilty of the murder of 24-year-old Chee Gaik Yap at the club in Taman Ria Jaya, Sungai Petani, between 5.30pm on Jan 14 and 3.05am on Jan 15, 2006.

Her body was found with multiple stab wounds by the roadside in a housing estate in Taman Ria Jaya near the club in the wee hours the next day. Deputy public prosecutor Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar objected Shahril's application on grounds that the facts presented by the prosecution fitted the principle of ""rarest of rare case"" and warranted the death sentence to be kept. He said the case was extraordinary and needed to be differentiated from other murder cases as it involved acts of violence on the victim who was jogging in a public place. ""She was jogging with her sister before she was kidnapped, sodomised, raped and killed and her body was dumped. She was treated with no respect and dignity at all. ""The applicant had fled to Australia for three years before he was arrested by the police at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport,"" he said. He said it was a brutal murder as forensic reports revealed there were 50 wounds on Chee's body, including her private parts. He submitted that hair cream marks, indicating that it was used as lubricant, were also found on Chee's private parts, therefore, dismissing the defence's submission that it was voluntary sex. Mohd Dusuki said Chee was her family's hope as she had just started working and was supposed to fly to Germany for training. Shahril's defence counsel, Rosli Kamaruddin urged the court to consider that his client was undergoing psychiatric treatment based on reports from specialists and affidavit that had been filed. Rosli said his client was 25 when the incident happened. ""He is remorseful and wants to go home to his family and live a normal life,"" he said."

Shahril faced 26 counts of receiving bribes totalling RM8,450 between April 9, 2018, and April 22, 2023. Alias was charged with four counts of receiving bribes totalling RM3,400 between June 16, 2019, and July 20, 2022. All the offences were allegedly committed at branches of banks in Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA2), Bandar Puchong Jaya, Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi, and Kajang. They allegedly received the bribes from a 38-year-old company owner through online bank transfers as an inducement not to inspect the company's lorries transporting goods from KLIA Cargo. They were charged under Section 17(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, punishable under Section 24(1) of the same act, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 20 years or a fine of not less than five times the amount or value of the bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher. The prosecution was conducted by Muhammad Asraf Mohamed Tahir, Nurul Atiqah Mohamad Alias, and Maziah Mohaide. The court allowed Rizal and Hanafie to be released on bail of RM15,000 each, Shahril was granted bail of RM10,000 and Alias was granted bail at RM8,000. All accused were ordered to surrender their passports to the court and report to the MACC office in Putrajaya at the beginning of each month. They were also prohibited from contacting or harassing prosecution witnesses. The court set July 11 for the case management and document submission for all accused. MACC had said on Monday that 23 Customs officers and personnel would be charged in six sessions courts nationwide by June 6 following their arrests during Op Samba 2.0. The operation, which ran from March 11 to 25, focused on those working at KLIA Cargo and detected a tax-evasion racket among Customs officers and company owners that evaded paying RM2 billion in duties on items like alcohol and tobacco."
Court rules AirAsia's retrenchment of high-salary engineers during pandemic unfair [NSTTV],New Straits Times,"May 29, 2024 @ 10:05am","KUALA LUMPUR: The Industrial Court has ruled that AirAsia Bhd's decision to retrench two aircraft engineers during the Covid-19 pandemic was ""improper"" and ""unfair,"" as it was based on their high salaries. Court chairman Andersen Ong said that the airline had ""adopted the wrong principles"" when it made its licensed aircraft engineers redundant despite the ""financial adversity"" it faced during the pandemic, FMT reported. He said that AirAsia failed to justify the ""last-in, first-out"" principle in retrenching Faisal Sulaiman and Izwan Nezar. In two separate awards on May 23, Ong concluded that targeting the claimants for retrenchment due to their higher salaries lacked good faith. Faisal and Izwan, who had each served AirAsia for 16 years, were awarded a combined sum of RM788,670 in back pay and compensation instead of reinstatement. Faisal, with a last-drawn salary of RM15,048, was awarded RM403,286. This included 24 months of back pay totalling RM361,152, reduced by 55 per cent to RM162,518.40 due to post-dismissal earnings, and RM240,768 as compensation instead of reinstatement. Izwan, earning RM14,380 per month, received RM385,384, which included back wages of RM155,304 after a similar deduction, plus RM230,080 as compensation instead of reinstatement. However, the court reduced the amounts payable to Faisal and Izwan by RM57,444 and RM55,440 respectively, to account for compensation payments already received. In the awards, Ong acknowledged that the Code of Conduct for Industrial Harmony (CCIH) prescribed by the Human Resources Ministry does not have the force of law and that the ""last-in, first-out"" principle is not a mandatory requirement in retrenchment exercises. But the Industrial Relations Act 1967 (IRA) and the CCIH, Ong highlighted, share a common objective, which is to promote and maintain industrial harmony. Section 30(5A) of the IRA allows the court to consider any minister-approved agreement or code. He said that employers must provide strong reasons for not following CCIH procedures in retrenchment. Ong also noted that the claimants were unfairly targeted for their higher salaries, calling such action unjust and discriminatory against experienced employees who contribute significantly to the company. AirAsia had argued that the pandemic forced it to halt operations and ground 96 per cent of its fleet, leading to a net operating loss of RM457 million in 2019 and RM953.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. The airline said it had to implement cost-containment measures, including manpower reductions, salary cuts, and restructuring. Despite these challenges, Ong ruled that the airline acted against the spirit of the CCIH. He emphasised that selecting employees for retrenchment based on salary disregards their contributions and can lead to age discrimination, as more experienced employees tend to earn higher salaries. S Selvarani of the Malaysian Trades Union Congress represented the claimants, while Wendy Lam and Wong Jia Ee represented AirAsia."

MACC has no evidence that Najib meddled in 1MDB's probe – Lawyer,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 28, 2024 @ 4:10pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) never had solid evidence to show that Datuk Seri Najib Razak was trying to hinder the probe in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) financial scandal, the High Court heard today. The former prime minister lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah accused MACC senior officer Nur Aida Arifin of making presumptuous observations, to which the latter disagreed. The senior lawyer said this when cross-examining Nur Aida who is testifying as a star prosecution witness in Najib's corruption trial for misappropriating millions of funds belonging to the sovereign state fund. Earlier, Nur Aida testified that Najib, who was then the finance minister, tried to hinder the 1MDB probe by restricting MACC's investigation, including attempting to close the case. ""While serving as prime minister, Najib undertook several actions, including replacing the MACC chief commissioner, ordering arrests of MACC officers, and ultimately leading to the former attorney-general, Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali, declaring the case as 'no further action' (NFA)."" Shafee then focused his line of questioning on the NFA by Apandi which the witness earlier stated came from a document containing talking points seized from Najib's former special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin. Nur Aida said the document was prepared by fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho based on Najib's instructions. Shafee: Is there anything that shows the instructions (NFA) came from Najib? Nur Aida: I have no direct evidence for that but everything that was stated in the notes really did happen. Amhari was Najib's own officer. Shafee: He (Amhari) was 'bought' using Low's money. You surely cannot say that Najib is involved in that too? Nur Aida: I did not investigate. Shafee: You have no evidence to say that this is a direct order (NFA) from Najib Nur Aida: The statement and notes seized from Amhari are enough. Muhammad Shafee: You are an IO but you are talking like you are at a coffee shop. Nur Aida: This is not a coffee shop, Tan Sri. Yes, there were no direct instructions but, in the investigation, as a whole, it did happen. Najib, 70, is facing four charges of using his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.3 billion from 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount. Hearing before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues."

28-year-old man remains stateless after court decision,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 28, 2024 @ 1:35pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Johor Baru High Court denied citizenship to a 28-year-old stateless man recently. Judge Datuk Seri Shamsulbahri Ibrahim in his judgment said the man failed to fulfill the provisions in the Federal Constitution to qualify for citizenship by operation of law. In 2012, the man's adoptive parents went to the National Registration Department (NRD) to complain that their application to renew the man's passport was rejected by the Immigration Department. The rejection was due to doubts about the man's appearance, as he looks Indian compared to his adoptive parents, who are Chinese. During interrogation by the NRD investigation and enforcement department, the couple admitted that the man was not their biological child, as he was given to them by his Indian mother on Oct 30, 1996, when he was then four-months-old.  The man's birth certificate was made available with the help of the couple's friend who was paid RM1,000 as a token. The court said there was no evidence produced by the applicants that the man was born in Malaysia nor at least one of his biological parents is a citizen or permanent resident during his birth. ""It is my view that this court must not simply presume that the man was born in Malaysia and his parent's citizenship status without an iota of evidence as a basis for the presumption. ""The application also failed to establish that the man was an abandoned child as there was neither any police report lodged that he was found exposed or abandoned nor any report as such to the NRD. ""There is not even a single information about the man that can be a guide to the court in determining whether he was genuinely an abandoned child or otherwise let alone his biological mother. ""All important particulars about him during his birth were either false or doubtful,"" Shamsulbahri said in his judgment dated May 24. The judge said there was no doubt that the introduction of Section 19B of Part III of the Second Scheduled to the Federal Constitution aims to grant citizenship by operation of law to newborn children found abandoned in the country. ""Nevertheless, the court has the responsibility to prevent this sacrosanct concept from been exploited by individuals to legitimise illegal activities, such as taking a child from elsewhere and later making him or her a Malaysian citizen through adoption."" The court said the couple's claim that they did not know the citizenship status of their adoptive son's biological parents does not automatically mean that the child is stateless. The court said as the couple admitted that they failed to trace their son's biological parents, it was impossible to determine his lineage, which would enable him to be conferred citizenship by descent. ""I sympathise with the man as this is not his fault. ""The door to be a Malaysian citizen is not yet closed to him as he may acquire citizenship by naturalisation under Article 19 of the Constitution,"" said the judge."
2 top CCID cops charged over RM1.25mil bribe to close Israeli 'spy' firearms purchase case [NSTTV],Dawn Chan,"May 28, 2024 @ 12:06pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A police assistant commissioner and a deputy superintendent claimed trial at the Sessions Court to charges of accepting RM1.25 million cash in bribes from a businessman to close a probe allegedly linked to the use of cryptocurrency to purchase firearms by an Israeli man. Bukit Aman forensic accounting investigation assistant head Assistant Commissioner Chin Khiam Kong,54, and the unit head of cryptocurrency investigations Deputy Superintendent Suhairon Abdullah,42, pleaded not guilty before judge Azura Alwi. On the first and second charge, Chin and Suhairon were accused as officers of the police force of having the common intention to agree to accept and dishonestly accepted RM1 million from Khoo Zixian,28, as gratification to assist to close investigations. They had committed the offences at about 12pm to 1pm and 4.29pm to 4.40pm on Apr 8 at the Commercial Crimes Investigation Department's forensic accounting investigation/cryptocurrency division meeting room and the carpark of Menara KPJ, Jalan Tun Razak. The offences framed under Section 16(a)(B) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 read with Section 34 of the Penal Code is punishable under Section 24(1) of the MACC Act. It provides a maximum 20-year jail term and a fine not more than five times the bribe sum or RM10,000; whichever is higher. Separately, in the same court, Chin claimed trial to two more charges of dishonestly agreeing to accept RM250,000, in his capacity as a police assistant commissioner, from Khoo to close investigations on a cheating case. He had committed the offences at about 12.30pm on April 18; and about 10.30am to 1pm on April 19 at the division's meeting room and at a carpark behind Menara KPJ. He was charged under Section 16(a)(B) of the MACC Act 2009 and punishable under Section 24(1) which provides maximum 20 year jail term and fine not more than five times the bribe sum or RM10,000; whichever higher. Deputy public prosecutor Syed Faisal Syed Amir urged the court to set bail at RM100,000 with one surety for each accused and to surrender their passports to the court. ""Our grounds for the bail sum is because the offences are serious, involving more than RM1 million and the jail term is not more than 20 years. ""If convicted, the accused can be fined not more than five times the bribe amount and in this case, the minimum is RM5 million. ""I believe our suggestion for RM100,000 for each accused with one surety and to surrender their passport to the court is reasonable,"" he said. In mitigation, Chin's counsel, Jacky Loi, pleaded for bail to be fixed at RM20,000 with one surety. He asked for no additional conditions as his client needed his passport to attend his youngest child's meet-the-parents event abroad in June. ""He is an assistant commissioner and has been in the police force for 29 years. ""Based on his service record, there is no evidence he will abscond and the bail sum should be appropriate to him as a civil servant. """"He is innocent until proven guilty. It is irrelevant for the prosecution to say the offence is serious as he has not been tried and the court has not found him guilty,"" he said. Suhairon's counsel, Ridha Abdah Subri, asked for RM15,000 bail with two sureties which he said was sufficient to secure his client's attendance in court. He said his client's family was not well to do and he was supporting his four school-going children and aged parents on a RM5,000 monthly salary. ""My client has been in service for 20 years and there is no reason for him abscond from his duties as his family is in Malaysia. ""He gave his cooperation to the police while under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 remand for 25 days. ""There is also no possibility of him tampering with prosecution's evidence. His family was able to collect RM15,000 for his bail and his wife and sister will be his bailors,"" he pleaded. Judge Azura set bail at RM40,000 with one or two sureties for each accused. She ordered them to surrender their passports to the court until case disposal. She allowed all the cases to go on trial together and fixed July 30 for mention. On May 10, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said seven policemen with ranks of assistant commissioner, deputy superintendent, inspector, sergeant and lance corporal, were arrested under the Sosma in connection to a RM1.25 million extortion case. He said investigations revealed that the suspects, aged 32 to 50, had acted in concert to commit crimes for their own gain. The investigation was conducted by the Bukit Aman Classified Crimes Investigation Unit of the Law/Prosecution Division of the Criminal Investigation Department under Section 384 of the Penal Code."

"Jho Low the 'puppet master' who carried out Najib's orders, witness tells 1MDB trial",Dawn Chan,"May 27, 2024 @ 6:40pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low, was a ""puppet master"" who controlled and strategised the operations of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

Under cross-examination by Shafee, Nur Aida, who was the 49th prosecution witness, said Low had strategised the operations of 1MDB. Shafee: You said Low was active in strategising the operations of 1MDB. You mean like the chess game, a puppet master? Nur Aida: Yes. Shafee: I put it to you he was in control? Nur Aida: Yes. Nur Aida also agreed when Shafee suggested to her that in the early days of the establishment of the Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA), Low was appointed as adviser by the then Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin. Established in 2009 as an entity owned by the Terengganu government, the TIA was later renamed 1MDB the same year. Nur Aida disagreed when Shafee suggested to her that former 1MDB chief executive officer Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi had developed a habit of taking orders from Low. He suggested this as the two had known each other for a long time. Shafee said this as Shahrol had worked at Accenture Malaysia, where Low's company, Utama Banking Group, was once its client. Shafee: I put it to you, seeing what happened in 1MDB, it looks like Shahrol has a habit of taking orders from Low. Nur Aida: I disagree. Shafee: Shahrol himself said in the court that all of his actions were based on orders from Low. Nur Aida: I agree because Low's orders were from Najib. It is not a habit.

MACC has no evidence that Najib meddled in 1MDB's probe – Lawyer,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 28, 2024 @ 4:10pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) never had solid evidence to show that Datuk Seri Najib Razak was trying to hinder the probe in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) financial scandal, the High Court heard today. The former prime minister lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah accused MACC senior officer Nur Aida Arifin of making presumptuous observations, to which the latter disagreed. The senior lawyer said this when cross-examining Nur Aida who is testifying as a star prosecution witness in Najib's corruption trial for misappropriating millions of funds belonging to the sovereign state fund. Earlier, Nur Aida testified that Najib, who was then the finance minister, tried to hinder the 1MDB probe by restricting MACC's investigation, including attempting to close the case. ""While serving as prime minister, Najib undertook several actions, including replacing the MACC chief commissioner, ordering arrests of MACC officers, and ultimately leading to the former attorney-general, Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali, declaring the case as 'no further action' (NFA)."" Shafee then focused his line of questioning on the NFA by Apandi which the witness earlier stated came from a document containing talking points seized from Najib's former special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin. Nur Aida said the document was prepared by fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho based on Najib's instructions. Shafee: Is there anything that shows the instructions (NFA) came from Najib? Nur Aida: I have no direct evidence for that but everything that was stated in the notes really did happen. Amhari was Najib's own officer. Shafee: He (Amhari) was 'bought' using Low's money. You surely cannot say that Najib is involved in that too? Nur Aida: I did not investigate. Shafee: You have no evidence to say that this is a direct order (NFA) from Najib Nur Aida: The statement and notes seized from Amhari are enough. Muhammad Shafee: You are an IO but you are talking like you are at a coffee shop. Nur Aida: This is not a coffee shop, Tan Sri. Yes, there were no direct instructions but, in the investigation, as a whole, it did happen.

The documents were related to Najib's fourth abuse of power charge, where he is alleged to have received RM44.5 million gratification for approving a US$975 million term loan facility from Deutsche Bank AG. Wan Azwan: These five documents are pivotal to the prosecution's case where Najib is claimed to have approved US$975 million from Deutsch Bank.  Nur Aida: I agree. Wan Azwan: Even though these documents can support the prosecution's case, they were never shown to Najib when his statement was recorded as the MACC knew the signature was not the same. Nur Aida: I disagree. Wan Azwan: Since the investigation did not refer the documents to Najib during the recording of his statement, it also did not give Najib a chance to clarify whether he actually signed the documents. Nur Aida: I agree. Nur Aida disagreed with Wan Azwan's contention that 1MDB's top management, with the assistance of several bank officials, had conspired to defraud Najib. Wan Azwan earlier suggested that former 1MDB chief executive Mohd Hazem Abdul Rahman and former chief financial officer Azmi Tahir had orchestrated a charade with BSI bank and Aabar Investments PJS Ltd officers to deceive Najib into believing that 1MDB investment monies were returning to the company in 2014. Najib, 70, is facing four charges of using his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.3 billion from 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount. Hearing before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues."
Terrorist groups using online video games to recruit young members,Mohamed Farid Noh,"May 25, 2024 @ 2:48pm","JOHOR BARU: The Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism (SEARCCT) revealed that terrorist groups are now using online video games to recruit young people to join their movement. The trend, which is seen as the latest threat to the country, was detected through horizon scanning carried out by SEARCCT to identify new potential threats to national security. Horizon scanning in the context of national security is a term which refers to a special system or method to identify and predict future threats involving the use of the internet and social media in the country. SEARCCT director of research and publication Kennimrod Sariburaja said online video games are very popular among the younger generation and are widely used. ""We found that online video games are very extensive and very difficult to monitor because it has its own gaming chat room.  ""It allows only certain members who have access to enter the chat room, thus allowing the administrator to exclusively filter who is allowed to enter the chat room. ""This video game chat room can not only be used to secretly spread the ideology of extremism, but also become a place to recruit members of terrorist groups or militants among young people in this region, including our country,"" he said during a discourse on the Sustainability of National Security, Unity and Harmony at the National Unity Week 2024 event held here yesterday. Also present was National Unity Minister Datuk Aaron Ago Dagang, ministry secretary-general Datuk Azman Mohd Yusof; deputy secretary general Mohamad Sobri Mat Daud and National Unity and Integration Department director-general Datuk Che Roslan Che Daud. Kennimrod said that the phenomenon of using  online video games as a platform to recruit the young to join terrorist groups has been growing in Southeast Asia. ""Last year, two teenagers aged 15 and 16 in Singapore were arrested for being recruited by a terrorist group to carry out attacks in the republic through online video game chat rooms. ""This threat is not only detected in neighbouring countries, but has the potential to grow in our country if comprehensive monitoring is not carried out starting at home, especially by parents. ""The terrorist group's modus operandi of recruiting the young generation has long spread in Western countries, especially right-wing extremist groups. In fact, these groups created online video games specifically to recruit new members in the West,"" he said. He said children in this country are exposed to online video games from as early as 10-years-old. ""This phenomenon needs to be examined so that it is not used as a platform to recruit young people to radical extremism that can risk national security. It is important for parents to monitor their children,"" he said. In Dec 2022, a 15-year-old Singaporean student with radical beliefs was reported to be the youngest to be issued with an Order of Detention under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in Singapore. He was accused of planning to carry out attacks on people in popular tourist areas of the republic in addition to being a suicide bomber. The teenager is one of two youths detained under the ISA. Another was a 16-year-old student who was placed under a Restriction Order , which restricts his movement and prevents him from making public statements. Kennimrod said the average Malaysian's internet usage is eight hours and 17 minutes, every day. This makes Malaysians the most active internet users in Southeast Asia, and third in the world, behind the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. ""Malaysia's internet users have succeeded in beating other Southeast Asian countries with larger populations, including Indonesia in second place, followed by the Philippines and Thailand,"" he said. He also stressed that in addition to the threat of online video games, Malaysia is also facing the threat of artificial intelligence (AI) technology as well as deepfakes which are believed to be the next wave in the battle over fake and distorted information online."

The woman, in her forties, said that initially, she and her husband did not want to lodge a police report, but after pictures and videos of Lew were circulated, she decided on Aug 2, 2021, to do so. She stated that she chose to make the report at the Bukit Aman Police Station on Aug 7, 2021, because Ebit Lew is a well-known preacher. ""At first, my husband and I planned not to report (to the police), let Allah alone respond to what Ebit did. But when we saw the many pictures and videos being circulated, we decided to report because there were many victims,"" she said. The witness was addressing a question by deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria during the main examination before Magistrate Nur Asyraf Zolhani. The witness stated that she and her husband also talked about the Facebook posts by Mohd Fairuz Abu or Akhi Fairuz Al-Jengkawi, the first prosecution witness regarding the sexual harassment by the famous preacher, on July 26, 2021. She said Akhi Fairuz was at Bukit Aman when she made the police report as a witness before she was taken to meet the third prosecution witness, Firdaus Wong. When asked if Akhi Fairuz and Wong offered any incentive or cut any deal with her to incriminate Lew, she said, ""No, none."" During the three-hour testimony, the woman revealed that she tried to block and unblock Lew's phone number on April 9, 2021, between 2.07 am and 11.44 pm. ""Yes, it's true, initially, I blocked him, but that day I felt confused. I became worried, so I blocked him. Because I was angry that he sent obscene messages and asked for obscene pictures, but at the same time, I unblocked (him) because I was worried that I had sent him some of my pictures,"" she said. ""That's why I unblocked him. He never apologised for his actions. So, to me, he hasn't changed. He's bad,"" said the witness. Lew, 38, faces 11 charges, including outraging the modesty of a woman in her 40s by sending obscene words and images to the victim's phone via WhatsApp between March and June 2021. The preacher is charged under Section 509 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, a fine, or both upon conviction. The trial resumes tomorrow. – BERNAMA"

The state Pas commissioner and Perlis PN chairman led the charge to a historic victory, winning 14 out of 15 state seats for grab to topple BN for the first time since the country's independence in 1957. The soft-spoken, down-to-earth leader hit all the right tones upon taking the Menteri Besar office by adopting a diplomatic, non-combative approach in dealing with the unity government at federal level. However, the relatively calm political landscape in this smallest state in the country was rocked by the arrest of Shukri's son by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in April.    Following is the chronology leading to his son's prosecution at the Kangar Session Court today. April 24, 2024: MACC detained six individuals including, the Menteri Besar's son, a political secretary and a civil servant to assist in the investigation regarding the alleged falsification of documents involving false claims amounting to RM600,000. They were subsequently remanded for two days to assist in the investigation related to the implementation of infrastructure development projects, such as repair and maintenance work, supplies and services, throughout Perlis since 2022. April 25, 2024: Menteri Besar Mohd Shukri Ramli confirmed that his son was among the six individuals remanded by MACC and said he did not harbor any suspicion towards the graft buster agency. He said his son should bear the consequences if found guilty while acknowledging his shortcomings in state administration were due to being too trusting and lenient. Shukri extended his full cooperation to MACC in assisting with the probe, stressing that he did not want any misconduct or wrongdoing in the state administration. April 26, 2024: MACC released all six suspects, including Menteri Besar's son, after their remand order expired. They were released on RM10,000 bail each. However, the investigation took a twist as it was reported that the MACC was also looking into the alleged supply of drinking water to the Raja of Perlis Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Jamalullail as part of its probe into false claims amounting to RM600,0000. It was reported that based on a copy of a payment note, dated Feb 19, that went viral, the RM19,505 worth of drinking water claim was allegedly supplied to Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin who is receiving treatment at the Tuanku Fauziah Hospital here. However, it was learnt that no such supply was delivered as claimed. April 28, 2024: The MACC Special Operations Division senior director Datuk Azmi Kamaruzaman confirmed that the graft buster agency was probing ""a senior political leader in a northern state"" over suspicion of appointing companies tied to him for supply projects amounting to RM300,000. The media have reported that sources claimed that the individual was also being probed for appointing a number of companies for road works and maintenance, using RM1 million in funds from the Menteri Besar's Office. The sources believed that the companies that were awarded with the projects were linked to the individual's son. The companies allegedly used documents with falsified information for the works that included the supply of mineral water as well as hampers and souvenirs. April 30, 2024: MACC detained Menteri Besar Mohd Shukri Ramli to assist in an investigation under Section 23 of the MACC Act 2009 involving an abuse of power issue. It was reported that he was detained about 11am when he arrived at the MACC headquarters in Putrajaya before being released on bail about 7pm after giving his statement. Upon leaving the MACC's headquarters, Shukri confirmed to the media representatives that he was being investigated by the graft buster agency but was unaware of which offense. May 22, 2024: MACC released a media coverage invitation letter, to notify that it has obtained permission to charge a company owner and a former political secretary in two separate courts today.

Norliza in her judgment said the abuse of the victim, which resulted in death, demonstrated that the accused showed no mercy towards the child. ""The court finds that a sentence of 35 years in prison and 12 strokes of the cane, in lieu of the death penalty, is appropriate and fair to the accused. ""The court, when passing the sentence, considered both the appeal of the accused and public interest.

The court said the victim was undoubtedly helpless to withstand the physical torture inflicted by the accused.

""For example, the pen gun is priced between RM200 to RM300 each and the cap gun is sold from RM300 onwards in Thailand. ""Some of them choose to buy the weapons online.

Chronology of Perlis Menteri Besar's son corruption case,Adie Zulkifli,"May 23, 2024 @ 10:48am","KANGAR: Retired teacher Mohd Shukri Ramli made history after being appointed as the first Perlis Menteri Besar who is not from Barisan Nasional (BN) following Perikatan Nasional's (PN) shocking sweeping victory in the November 2022 state election. The state Pas commissioner and Perlis PN chairman led the charge to a historic victory, winning 14 out of 15 state seats for grab to topple BN for the first time since the country's independence in 1957. The soft-spoken, down-to-earth leader hit all the right tones upon taking the Menteri Besar office by adopting a diplomatic, non-combative approach in dealing with the unity government at federal level. However, the relatively calm political landscape in this smallest state in the country was rocked by the arrest of Shukri's son by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in April.    Following is the chronology leading to his son's prosecution at the Kangar Session Court today. April 24, 2024: MACC detained six individuals including, the Menteri Besar's son, a political secretary and a civil servant to assist in the investigation regarding the alleged falsification of documents involving false claims amounting to RM600,000. They were subsequently remanded for two days to assist in the investigation related to the implementation of infrastructure development projects, such as repair and maintenance work, supplies and services, throughout Perlis since 2022. April 25, 2024: Menteri Besar Mohd Shukri Ramli confirmed that his son was among the six individuals remanded by MACC and said he did not harbor any suspicion towards the graft buster agency. He said his son should bear the consequences if found guilty while acknowledging his shortcomings in state administration were due to being too trusting and lenient. Shukri extended his full cooperation to MACC in assisting with the probe, stressing that he did not want any misconduct or wrongdoing in the state administration. April 26, 2024: MACC released all six suspects, including Menteri Besar's son, after their remand order expired. They were released on RM10,000 bail each. However, the investigation took a twist as it was reported that the MACC was also looking into the alleged supply of drinking water to the Raja of Perlis Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Jamalullail as part of its probe into false claims amounting to RM600,0000. It was reported that based on a copy of a payment note, dated Feb 19, that went viral, the RM19,505 worth of drinking water claim was allegedly supplied to Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin who is receiving treatment at the Tuanku Fauziah Hospital here. However, it was learnt that no such supply was delivered as claimed. April 28, 2024: The MACC Special Operations Division senior director Datuk Azmi Kamaruzaman confirmed that the graft buster agency was probing ""a senior political leader in a northern state"" over suspicion of appointing companies tied to him for supply projects amounting to RM300,000. The media have reported that sources claimed that the individual was also being probed for appointing a number of companies for road works and maintenance, using RM1 million in funds from the Menteri Besar's Office. The sources believed that the companies that were awarded with the projects were linked to the individual's son. The companies allegedly used documents with falsified information for the works that included the supply of mineral water as well as hampers and souvenirs. April 30, 2024: MACC detained Menteri Besar Mohd Shukri Ramli to assist in an investigation under Section 23 of the MACC Act 2009 involving an abuse of power issue. It was reported that he was detained about 11am when he arrived at the MACC headquarters in Putrajaya before being released on bail about 7pm after giving his statement. Upon leaving the MACC's headquarters, Shukri confirmed to the media representatives that he was being investigated by the graft buster agency but was unaware of which offense. May 22, 2024: MACC released a media coverage invitation letter, to notify that it has obtained permission to charge a company owner and a former political secretary in two separate courts today. According to the invitation letter, the company owner will be charged in the Kangar Sessions Court while the former political secretary will be charged in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court.

Car washer escapes gallows for distributing 7.3kg drugs,Faris Fuad,"May 20, 2024 @ 2:07pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A car washer escaped the gallows after the Court of Appeal commuted his sentence to 30 years in prison and 12 strokes of the cane for trafficking 7.3kg of drugs at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). A three-judge panel chaired by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, together with Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin decided on the punishment for Chui Kah Fai for an offence he committed in 2019. In this case, Chuii as the appellant said that the luggage brought to KLIA belonged to an employer known as Jackie. He claimed to have been told by his employer that the bag in question contained valuable premium tea that needed to be taken to Sabah. He also denied knowing that the bag contained drugs. However, he was convicted after a Shah Alam High Court judge dismissed his defence of being an innocent carrier. Hadhariah said the High Court had made the right decision when it rejected the 'innocent carrier' defence. Chui was charged with distributing methamphetamine weighing 7.296kg at the scanning machine on Level 5 of KLIA in Sepang, at 5.10pm on Oct 27, 2019. On Jan 21, 2022, the High Court sentenced him to death after being found guilty of drug trafficking. Hadhariah said the panel unanimously found the conviction of the appellant to be safe. However, she said following the Mandatory Death Penalty Abolition Act 2023, the death penalty is no longer mandatory. ""The court has the discretionary power to impose an alternative sentence of 30 years imprisonment and no less than 12 lashes. In fact, the prosecution offered an alternative sentence and it was accepted by the appellant. ""Therefore, the Court of Appeal set aside the death sentence and replaced it with 30 years' imprisonment and 12 lashes."""

The charge was framed under Section 21 of the Control of Supplies Act 1961. The offence is punishable under Section 22(1) of the same Act, which carries a fine of up to RM1 million or a maximum of three years' imprisonment or both upon conviction. Deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Hezrin Abd Wahab and Mohd Hilmi Abu Hassan prosecuted while lawyer Adam Majid represented both the accused. In mitigation, Adam told the court that both men regretted their mistake and pledged not to repeat it. He also told the court that Zhaw had a wife and six children while U was married with two children, aged 8 and 6, to support. However, Hezrin pressed for a commensurate punishment to serve as a lesson. He also urged the court to take into into account the public interest, adding that the government had increased the penalty for the offence. The judge subsequently passed the sentence on both accused. She ordered that they serve the sentence from the date of their arrest on Feb 24 last year. The court also ordered the proceeds from the sale of the diesel worth RM13,330 and other items seized in the raid to be forfeited to the government."

(UPDATED) Ulu Tiram police station shooting suspect believed to have links to JI [NSTTV],Jassmine Shadiqe,"May 17, 2024 @ 11:41am","JOHOR BARU: The suspect who stormed a police station in Ulu Tiram here early this morning, killing two policemen and injuring another, is believed to have links to Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said five members of the suspect's family have been arrested and JI material was found at the suspect's home. JI is a militant Islamist group founded in 1993 by Indonesians Abu Bakar Bashir and Abdullah Sungkar. The group has historical ties to al-Qaeda and has been involved in various high-profile terrorist attacks, most notably the 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people. Abu Bakar, was jailed in Indonesia in 2011 after his arrest in 2010, but freed in January 2021 after serving 11 years of his 15-year sentence. In Malaysia, JI's presence has been significant, particularly as it served as a safe haven and operational base for its leaders during the 1980s and 1990s. Inspector-General of Police, at that time, Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said Abu Bakar Bashir will be closely monitored by Bukit Aman's Counter Terrorism Division if he is released by the Indonesian government, as this is necessary as Malaysia was faced with on-going threats from JI activities. The other founder, Abdullah Sungkar, meanwhile died in October, 1999.In the early 2000s, Malaysian authorities arrested several senior JI members, disrupting their networks. Despite these efforts, JI continues to pose a threat, maintaining its ideological influence and capacity for recruitment and indoctrination through various Islamic schools and personal networks. The organisation's key members include: Hambali (Riduan Isamuddin): Hambali is a senior leader of JI. Before his capture in Thailand, he used Malaysia as a base for coordinating JI operations and was involved in planning several attacks, including the 2002 Bali bombings. Noordin Mohammad Top: A Malaysian citizen, Noordin was a key recruiter and strategist for JI. He was involved in several bombings in Indonesia, including the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta. Noordin used Malaysia as a safe haven and a place to plan attacks. Azahari Husin: Another prominent Malaysian member of JI, Azahari was an expert bomb-maker and played a crucial role in the Bali bombings and other attacks in Indonesia. He, like Noordin, utilized Malaysia for operational purposes. Zulkifli bin Hir (Marwan): A Malaysian militant affiliated with JI, Marwan was involved in terrorism activities in the Philippines. He was linked to several bombings and was on the FBI's most-wanted list before being killed in a raid in the Philippines in 2015. Mas Selamat Kastari: Originally from Singapore, Mas Selamat was associated with JI and used Malaysia as a hiding place after escaping from detention in Singapore in 2008. He was eventually captured in Malaysia in 2009. Yazid Sufaat: A Malaysian microbiologist and former army captain, Yazid was linked to JI and al-Qaeda. He provided logistical support to militants and was involved in anthrax research for al-Qaeda. Yazid was detained several times by Malaysian authorities under the Internal Security Act."

Four detained by MACC over failed tube wells project in Kelantan out on bail,Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"May 18, 2024 @ 1:22pm","KOTA BARU: The four individuals arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) on May 15 over a probe into a failed tube wells project in the state have been released on bail. Magistrate Rais Imran Hamid allowed them to be released after their three-day remand order ended today. The remand order against the four began on May 16. The magistrate also ordered the four to be released on RM10,000 bail with one surety each. He also ordered that they report themselves at the state MACC office once a month.

MACC detained the four, aged between 40 to 60, in separate locations in Kota Baru on Wednesday. The arrests came after the New Straits Times reported on the plight of villagers in Kota Baru who had been struggling with water supply. Following the arrest, MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki confirmed that MACC was investigating 10 tube well projects by state-owned water company Air Kelantan Sdn Bhd (AKSB) that failed to function. He said the projects, worth some RM300 million, were carried out by AKSB between 2008 and 2015.

Azam also confirmed the arrest of four people in connection with the investigation into the construction of the tube well projects in Kelantan which failed to supply water to the residents. ""The tube wells built by the company should supply raw water to the water treatment plant before it is distributed to consumers. ""The construction of HCWs of different capacities is an alternative to overcome the water problem in the state, especially during the dry season.

Ex-sugarcane seller's death sentence for murder of maid commuted to 40 years in jail,Dawn Chan,"May 20, 2024 @ 4:39pm","PUTRAJAYA: A former sugarcane seller had his death sentence commuted to a maximum 40 years in jail for the murder of his Indonesian maid 15 years ago. A three-judge panel chaired by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat made the unanimous decision. They had allowed the review application of A. Murugan, 50, under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act. Tengku Maimun, who sat with Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who is Court of Appeal president, and Datuk Nordin Hassan set aside the death penalty and ordered Murugan to serve the jail term from the date of his arrest on Oct 21,2009. Murugan was convicted of the murder of Muntik Bani, 36, at his house in Taman Sentosa, Klang, between Oct 18 and Oct 20, 2009. Defence counsel Sangeet Kaur Deo had asked for a jail term of less than 40 years as his client was dependent on medication and he was once in a coma for six months after a surgery. Sangeet had asked for the death sentence to be set aside after facts showed the victim had received treatment for six days before she died. Deputy public prosecutor How Mei Ling urged the death sentence to be maintained as Muntik was violently, cruelly and inhumanely killed. She said Murugan had taken advantage of the victim, who had gone to his house to seek shelter, but instead, she was abused until she suffered backbone injuries. ""The injuries caused her difficulties in moving after she was repeatedly assaulted. ""Her legs were splashed with hot water while her head was shaved, when she did not do anything wrong to the man. ""She was also confined to a locked toilet for two days, without food and water. ""When she arrived at the hospital, she could not open her eyes and her body was full of injuries and she was infected."" How said her death was inevitable due to the injuries she had suffered as all major internal organs had failed due to the actions of the accused. In Muntik's statement to the police, she said she was married with three kids in Indonesia and had been in the country for five years and had initially worked at the home of one ""Miss Hung"". Muntik had said that while at Murugan's home, she was confined to the toilet for two nights without being given food and drinks. She had said she was often beaten and kicked on her back while her right hand was broken as she was hit with a broomstick. The victim was described as being ""near death"" when she was rescued from Murugan's house and had her head shaved. She died six days later at Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital in Klang."

"Ipoh Timor MP: Multifaceted approach needed to stop surge in extremism, violent crimes",Luqman Hakim,"May 19, 2024 @ 6:02pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Ipoh Timor member of parliament Howard Lee Chuan How has called for a multifaceted approach to address the surge in extremist movements and violent crimes. He said the recent incidents highlight the urgent need to address the root causes of extremism and the rise of xenophobic and supremacist narratives in public discourse. These include the attack on the Ulu Tiram police station and the capture of two men with parang in Istana Negara. ""The surge in extremist movements and violent crimes is not an isolated phenomenon but a continuation of a worrying pattern,"" ""An elected MP narrowly escaping death by arson and the inflammatory rhetoric from a senior academic are just a few examples of the escalating situation,"" he said in a Facebook posting today. Lee pointed to the proliferation of racially charged and ethno-religious supremacist narratives in public discourse, which he described as increasingly disconcerting. ""These incendiary narratives, often disguised as religious doctrine or cultural preservation, are spreading through WhatsApp groups and social media, widening divisions and fostering mistrust among Malaysia's diverse communities. ""Political operatives and organisations exploiting ethnic and religious identities for political gain are deepening these tensions, creating an environment conducive to extremism."" Drawing on international examples, Lee highlighted successful de-radicalisation programmes from Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. ""Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Nayef Centre for Counseling and Advice and the 'Sakinah Campaign' have shown significant success in reducing recidivism among radicalised individuals. ""Indonesia's 'Deradikalisasi' campaign offers comprehensive rehabilitation programmes that address both ideological and social factors contributing to radicalisation."" Lee proposed a five-point plan to address the surge in extremist movements and violent crimes in Malaysia: * Legislation Against Hate Speech: Implement laws specifically targeting hate speech and incitement to violence, protecting freedom of expression while curbing harmful speech. * Comprehensive Deradicalisation Programmes: Invest in programmes offering religious counselling, psychological support, vocational training, and community reintegration to rehabilitate individuals influenced by or under the influence of extremist ideologies and prevent recidivism. * Educational Initiatives: Emphasise values of multiculturalism, tolerance, and mutual respect in educational curricula to build a resilient Malaysian identity. * Community Engagement: Collaborate with religious leaders, scholars, and NGOs to promote moderate, inclusive interpretations of religion and foster social harmony. * Domestic Research on Terrorism and Radicalisation: Scale up the Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism (SEARCCT) with more funding and integration into domestic counter-terrorism efforts. ""By tackling the root causes of extremism and propagating an inclusive and tolerant public discourse, Malaysia can cultivate a safer and more cohesive nation for all its citizens. ""Ultimately, the age-old adage of 'stronger together' has never been more important, with these undercurrents of hate spilling out to the fore. ""The very fabric of our peaceful and harmonious pluralistic nation is seeing the beginnings of an existential attack. We must come together to do nothing less than nipping it in the bud,"" he said."

Ex-sugarcane seller's death sentence for murder of maid commuted to 40 years in jail,Dawn Chan,"May 20, 2024 @ 4:39pm","PUTRAJAYA: A former sugarcane seller had his death sentence commuted to a maximum 40 years in jail for the murder of his Indonesian maid 15 years ago. A three-judge panel chaired by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat made the unanimous decision. They had allowed the review application of A. Murugan, 50, under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act. Tengku Maimun, who sat with Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who is Court of Appeal president, and Datuk Nordin Hassan set aside the death penalty and ordered Murugan to serve the jail term from the date of his arrest on Oct 21,2009. Murugan was convicted of the murder of Muntik Bani, 36, at his house in Taman Sentosa, Klang, between Oct 18 and Oct 20, 2009. Defence counsel Sangeet Kaur Deo had asked for a jail term of less than 40 years as his client was dependent on medication and he was once in a coma for six months after a surgery. Sangeet had asked for the death sentence to be set aside after facts showed the victim had received treatment for six days before she died. Deputy public prosecutor How Mei Ling urged the death sentence to be maintained as Muntik was violently, cruelly and inhumanely killed. She said Murugan had taken advantage of the victim, who had gone to his house to seek shelter, but instead, she was abused until she suffered backbone injuries. ""The injuries caused her difficulties in moving after she was repeatedly assaulted. ""Her legs were splashed with hot water while her head was shaved, when she did not do anything wrong to the man. ""She was also confined to a locked toilet for two days, without food and water.

A three-judge panel chaired by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, together with Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin decided on the punishment for Chui Kah Fai for an offence he committed in 2019.

However, he was convicted after a Shah Alam High Court judge dismissed his defence of being an innocent carrier. Hadhariah said the High Court had made the right decision when it rejected the 'innocent carrier' defence. Chui was charged with distributing methamphetamine weighing 7.296kg at the scanning machine on Level 5 of KLIA in Sepang, at 5.10pm on Oct 27, 2019. On Jan 21, 2022, the High Court sentenced him to death after being found guilty of drug trafficking. Hadhariah said the panel unanimously found the conviction of the appellant to be safe.

In fact, the prosecution offered an alternative sentence and it was accepted by the appellant. ""Therefore, the Court of Appeal set aside the death sentence and replaced it with 30 years' imprisonment and 12 lashes."""

"Ipoh Timor MP: Multifaceted approach needed to stop surge in extremism, violent crimes",Luqman Hakim,"May 19, 2024 @ 6:02pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Ipoh Timor member of parliament Howard Lee Chuan How has called for a multifaceted approach to address the surge in extremist movements and violent crimes. He said the recent incidents highlight the urgent need to address the root causes of extremism and the rise of xenophobic and supremacist narratives in public discourse. These include the attack on the Ulu Tiram police station and the capture of two men with parang in Istana Negara. ""The surge in extremist movements and violent crimes is not an isolated phenomenon but a continuation of a worrying pattern,"" ""An elected MP narrowly escaping death by arson and the inflammatory rhetoric from a senior academic are just a few examples of the escalating situation,"" he said in a Facebook posting today. Lee pointed to the proliferation of racially charged and ethno-religious supremacist narratives in public discourse, which he described as increasingly disconcerting. ""These incendiary narratives, often disguised as religious doctrine or cultural preservation, are spreading through WhatsApp groups and social media, widening divisions and fostering mistrust among Malaysia's diverse communities. ""Political operatives and organisations exploiting ethnic and religious identities for political gain are deepening these tensions, creating an environment conducive to extremism."" Drawing on international examples, Lee highlighted successful de-radicalisation programmes from Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. ""Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Nayef Centre for Counseling and Advice and the 'Sakinah Campaign' have shown significant success in reducing recidivism among radicalised individuals. ""Indonesia's 'Deradikalisasi' campaign offers comprehensive rehabilitation programmes that address both ideological and social factors contributing to radicalisation."" Lee proposed a five-point plan to address the surge in extremist movements and violent crimes in Malaysia: * Legislation Against Hate Speech: Implement laws specifically targeting hate speech and incitement to violence, protecting freedom of expression while curbing harmful speech. * Comprehensive Deradicalisation Programmes: Invest in programmes offering religious counselling, psychological support, vocational training, and community reintegration to rehabilitate individuals influenced by or under the influence of extremist ideologies and prevent recidivism. * Educational Initiatives: Emphasise values of multiculturalism, tolerance, and mutual respect in educational curricula to build a resilient Malaysian identity. * Community Engagement: Collaborate with religious leaders, scholars, and NGOs to promote moderate, inclusive interpretations of religion and foster social harmony. * Domestic Research on Terrorism and Radicalisation: Scale up the Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter-Terrorism (SEARCCT) with more funding and integration into domestic counter-terrorism efforts. ""By tackling the root causes of extremism and propagating an inclusive and tolerant public discourse, Malaysia can cultivate a safer and more cohesive nation for all its citizens. ""Ultimately, the age-old adage of 'stronger together' has never been more important, with these undercurrents of hate spilling out to the fore. ""The very fabric of our peaceful and harmonious pluralistic nation is seeing the beginnings of an existential attack. We must come together to do nothing less than nipping it in the bud,"" he said."

Ex-sugarcane seller's death sentence for murder of maid commuted to 40 years in jail,Dawn Chan,"May 20, 2024 @ 4:39pm","PUTRAJAYA: A former sugarcane seller had his death sentence commuted to a maximum 40 years in jail for the murder of his Indonesian maid 15 years ago. A three-judge panel chaired by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat made the unanimous decision. They had allowed the review application of A. Murugan, 50, under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act. Tengku Maimun, who sat with Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who is Court of Appeal president, and Datuk Nordin Hassan set aside the death penalty and ordered Murugan to serve the jail term from the date of his arrest on Oct 21,2009. Murugan was convicted of the murder of Muntik Bani, 36, at his house in Taman Sentosa, Klang, between Oct 18 and Oct 20, 2009. Defence counsel Sangeet Kaur Deo had asked for a jail term of less than 40 years as his client was dependent on medication and he was once in a coma for six months after a surgery. Sangeet had asked for the death sentence to be set aside after facts showed the victim had received treatment for six days before she died. Deputy public prosecutor How Mei Ling urged the death sentence to be maintained as Muntik was violently, cruelly and inhumanely killed. She said Murugan had taken advantage of the victim, who had gone to his house to seek shelter, but instead, she was abused until she suffered backbone injuries. ""The injuries caused her difficulties in moving after she was repeatedly assaulted. ""Her legs were splashed with hot water while her head was shaved, when she did not do anything wrong to the man. ""She was also confined to a locked toilet for two days, without food and water. ""When she arrived at the hospital, she could not open her eyes and her body was full of injuries and she was infected."" How said her death was inevitable due to the injuries she had suffered as all major internal organs had failed due to the actions of the accused. In Muntik's statement to the police, she said she was married with three kids in Indonesia and had been in the country for five years and had initially worked at the home of one ""Miss Hung"". Muntik had said that while at Murugan's home, she was confined to the toilet for two nights without being given food and drinks. She had said she was often beaten and kicked on her back while her right hand was broken as she was hit with a broomstick. The victim was described as being ""near death"" when she was rescued from Murugan's house and had her head shaved. She died six days later at Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital in Klang."

"Sanusi is Menteri Besar, not a terrorist, says counsel",Dawn Chan,"May 17, 2024 @ 3:03pm","SHAH ALAM: ""My client is a Menteri Besar, not a terrorist."" That was the argument of Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor's defence counsel, Awang Armadajaya Awang Mahmud who had repeatedly requested the prosecution to furnish the list of witnesses who will testify in his client's sedition trial. During proceedings before High Court judge Datuk Aslam Zainuddin today, Awang Armadajaya had raised the issue of the prosecution not furnishing the list seven days after the previous proceedings, despite being promised. Awang Armadajaya had again stressed the importance of the list to ensure that Sanusi, 50, does not come in contact with any of the potential witnesses in his capacity as the menteri besar. ""This is not a terrorism case. My client is not a terrorist and would not pose danger to anyone. ""My client is a menteri besar. The issue of posing danger to a witness in terms of safety does not arise at all. ""If you want to equate him to terrorists or a criminal, that is not right. ""The main aim is so that we do not breach the principles of law and that the defence do not meet with prosecution witness, even inadvertently. ""However, if this arises in the future, I will highlight that I have repeatedly raised this matter and my client cannot be blamed for this,"" he said. Awang Armadajaya had applied for the prosecution to furnish the list soon and the witness statements by June 15. However, deputy public prosecutor Datuk Masri Mohd Daud maintained the prosecution's stance that the documents will be handed over to the defence at least 14 days before the commencement of the trial on July 22. Earlier, Masri told the court that the Attorney-General's Chambers had rejected Sanusi's representation letter to drop his two sedition charges of uttering seditious remarks against the Sultan of Selangor and the Yang di-Pertuan Agong last year. The dismissal of the representation letter sees the Jeneri assemblyman going to trial and the court set 10-days commencing on July 22, 23, 29, 30 and Aug 5, 6, 9, 12, 13 and 23."
"I just wanted to know why businessman and minister were on the same flight, says Azmin",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 17, 2024 @ 2:59pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former international trade and industry minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali said he mentioned Deepak Jaikishan in his speech as there was a photo of the businessman with a minister on a plane, the High Court heard. He said the picture showing Deepak with Agriculture and Food Security Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu sitting together in a flight emerged a few days after the latter answered questions in Parliament regarding the government's special permit to import eggs from India. Azmin said he brought up Deepak's name in a talk titled ""Ceramah Perdana: Solidariti Menentang Kezaliman"" near Taman Melawar here on March 11 last year because he was questioning why Deepak was on the same plane as Mohamad. He was testifying as a witness in a defamation suit brought against him by J&E Advance Tech Sdn Bhd over allegations that the company was awarded a project to import eggs from India via direct negotiation with the government. Azmin, who was cross-examined by lawyer T. Gunaseelan, said he wanted to seek clarification from Deepak, Mohamed and the ministry about the picture, to which they never responded. Gunaseelan: Why did you mention Deepak's name? Azmin: I questioned it after he was seen with the minister on the plane. Gunaseelan: Are you still alleging that the plaintiff (J&E) obtained import permits unlawfully? Azmin: I never made accusations against J&E... I only questioned the lack of transparency in the process of importing eggs from India. Gunaseelan: But do you need to mention Deepak's name or the plaintiff? Azmin: That is not correct. The issue arose two days after the announcement, when a photo of the minister (Mohamed) and Deepak surfaced... Is it wrong for me to raise it? The company is seeking general, exemplary and aggravated damages from Azmin. It is also seeking a court order to stop Azmin from repeating his statement. On March 12, last year, during a Perikatan Nasional ceramah in Taman Melewar, Azmin alleged that the government had awarded the project to import eggs from India via direct negotiations. He claimed that the direct awarding of the contract contradicted the promise of an open tender process made by the unity government led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. Azmin also claimed that Mohamad, as the minister in charge, had taken the businessman involved in his visit to India recently. On Feb 28, last year, Mohamad was reported to have said that only one company was permitted to import eggs from India and that the move was taken to resolve the lack of supply in the local market. However, when questioned by Putrajaya member of parliament Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin, Mohamad admitted that the company did not go through the open tender process because it was a ""special case""."

Dr M calls for probe into former A-G Apandi's handling of 1MDB scandal,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 17, 2024 @ 2:06pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the government should initiate criminal proceedings against former Attorney-General (AG) Tan Sri Apandi Ali for his involvement in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) financial scandal. The former Langkawi member of parliament said it was unfair that only Datuk Seri Najib Razak had been incarcerated for the global-scale financial scandal.    He said this in response to the Federal Court's dismissal of Apandi's leave application to reinstate his RM10 million defamation suit against DAP adviser Tan Sri Lim Kit Siang on Tuesday. Apandi filed the lawsuit over an article that questioned the former A-G's role in aiding and abetting in the 1MDB financial scandal. Dr Mahathir said the government's decision in 2018, during which he was the then prime minister, to terminate Apandi's service as A-G was correct. ""Apandi filed the suit against Lim, alleging defamation for portraying 'that he was immoral, unethical, and lacking integrity while holding the position of A-G. ""Beginning in the High Court, followed by the Court of Appeal, and now the Federal Court, all seven judges agreed that Apandi's main failure was in carrying out his responsibilities as A-G. ""The Court of Appeal also stated that when Apandi abruptly decided to halt the 1MDB probe, it reinforced the public perception that Apandi was covering up the scandal. ""The judge also said that Apandi, who was entrusted with the power to direct investigations to resolve cases and prosecute those responsible without fear or favour, had acted contrary to this and attempted to obstruct the investigation into the 1MDB scandal,"" he said in his recent blog post yesterday. Dr Mahathir said the judge also pointed out that Apandi failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he did not ""assist and abet"" Najib in the scandal. He said this had proven that his action to terminate Apandi as A-G when he was the prime minister in 2018 was correct. Apandi subsequently filed a RM2.2 million lawsuit against the government and named Dr Mahathir as the defendant, claiming unlawful termination. However, Apandi had reached a settlement with the government after the latter had agreed to settle the suit without admission of liability. ""That is why I disagree with the government's decision in 2022 to settle Apandi's dismissal lawsuit, as I was informed it involved a substantial compensation payout. ""Based on the judgments of those courts, I feel that the termination of Apandi's service was the right decision. ""In fact, the government following my leadership should have reported Apandi to the police regarding the crimes he committed related to the 1MDB scandal. ""It is unfair if only Najib is punished while Apandi whom the judges have openly stated as 'assisting and abetting', is freed and compensated by the government,"" he added. Apandi's suit centres on an article by Lim published in the news portal Malaysiakini, titled ""Dangerous fallacy to think Malaysia's on the road to integrity"" on May 6, three years ago. The suit claimed Lim had deliberately or indirectly implied that Apandi was involved in criminal activities, and was someone who was unethical, immoral, incompetent and lacked responsibility, knowledge, expertise and other professional ethics to hold the post of A-G at the material time."

(UPDATED) Ulu Tiram police station shooting suspect believed to have links to JI [NSTTV],Jassmine Shadiqe,"May 17, 2024 @ 11:41am","JOHOR BARU: The suspect who stormed a police station in Ulu Tiram here early this morning, killing two policemen and injuring another, is believed to have links to Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said five members of the suspect's family have been arrested and JI material was found at the suspect's home. JI is a militant Islamist group founded in 1993 by Indonesians Abu Bakar Bashir and Abdullah Sungkar. The group has historical ties to al-Qaeda and has been involved in various high-profile terrorist attacks, most notably the 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people. Abu Bakar, was jailed in Indonesia in 2011 after his arrest in 2010, but freed in January 2021 after serving 11 years of his 15-year sentence. In Malaysia, JI's presence has been significant, particularly as it served as a safe haven and operational base for its leaders during the 1980s and 1990s. Inspector-General of Police, at that time, Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said Abu Bakar Bashir will be closely monitored by Bukit Aman's Counter Terrorism Division if he is released by the Indonesian government, as this is necessary as Malaysia was faced with on-going threats from JI activities. The other founder, Abdullah Sungkar, meanwhile died in October, 1999.In the early 2000s, Malaysian authorities arrested several senior JI members, disrupting their networks. Despite these efforts, JI continues to pose a threat, maintaining its ideological influence and capacity for recruitment and indoctrination through various Islamic schools and personal networks. The organisation's key members include: Hambali (Riduan Isamuddin): Hambali is a senior leader of JI. Before his capture in Thailand, he used Malaysia as a base for coordinating JI operations and was involved in planning several attacks, including the 2002 Bali bombings. Noordin Mohammad Top: A Malaysian citizen, Noordin was a key recruiter and strategist for JI. He was involved in several bombings in Indonesia, including the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing in Jakarta. Noordin used Malaysia as a safe haven and a place to plan attacks. Azahari Husin: Another prominent Malaysian member of JI, Azahari was an expert bomb-maker and played a crucial role in the Bali bombings and other attacks in Indonesia. He, like Noordin, utilized Malaysia for operational purposes. Zulkifli bin Hir (Marwan): A Malaysian militant affiliated with JI, Marwan was involved in terrorism activities in the Philippines. He was linked to several bombings and was on the FBI's most-wanted list before being killed in a raid in the Philippines in 2015. Mas Selamat Kastari: Originally from Singapore, Mas Selamat was associated with JI and used Malaysia as a hiding place after escaping from detention in Singapore in 2008. He was eventually captured in Malaysia in 2009. Yazid Sufaat: A Malaysian microbiologist and former army captain, Yazid was linked to JI and al-Qaeda. He provided logistical support to militants and was involved in anthrax research for al-Qaeda. Yazid was detained several times by Malaysian authorities under the Internal Security Act."

Judge Diana Md Razali passed the sentence after the defence failed to raise reasonable doubt against the prosecution's case. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) in a statement today said Monarch Lodge Development was charged with the offence of intentionally digging and damaging TM's network infrastructure, especially nine conduit routes and six routes at Kilometre 8.2, Jalan Seremban-Port Dickson, Port Dickson, Negri Sembilan.

According to MCMC, the results of an investigation found that the damage to TM's network facilities was caused by excavation work carried out by the developer in relation to the Bandar Pelancongan Kota Lukut development project in Port Dickson. It said that as a result of the damage to TM's network facilities, it affected the service to TM customers in the area. ""MCMC takes a serious view of this issue and reminded all development companies to adhere to safety measures as outlined in the Guidelines for the Relocation and Reinstallation of Utilities in Government Programmes and Projects,"" the statement said. ""The guidelines are aimed at giving clarification regarding the scope of compliance, funding methods, implementation methods, and the application of the latest work procedures for utility relocation and reinstallation works at all project sites in federal and state reserves."" The guidelines, the MACC said, also guarantee protection of public utility facilities, especially network facilities. ""Apart from this, MCMC also suggests that contractors or development companies use the 'Call Before You Dig (CBYD)' portal for the purpose of construction works to be carried out when involving network facilities.

[Updated] Appeals Court sets July 23 for verdict on appeal by 5 former UNPM students,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 16, 2024 @ 1:27pm","PUTRAJAYA: The Court of Appeal has set July 23 to deliver its verdict on the appeal by six former National Defence Universiti (UPNM) cadets against their conviction for the manslaughter of navy cadet Zulfarhan Osman Zulkarnain seven years ago. A three-member bench Court of Appeal led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail fixed the date after hearing lengthy submissions from both parties today. Other members of the bench were Mohamed Zaini Mazlan and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. The six are - Muhammad Akmal Zuhairi Azmal, Muhammad Azamuddin Mad Sofi, Muhammad Najib Mohd Razi, Muhammad Afif Najmudin Azahat, Mohamad Shobirin Sabri and Abdoul Hakeem Mohd Ali. Earlier, counsel Amer Hamzah Arshad, who appeared for Muhammad Akmal and Muhammad Azamuddin said the court should consider the fact that the accused deserve a second chance. ""If the court agrees with the High Court's decision that the accused are guilty under Section 304 of the Penal Code, the prison sentence should be reduced to 12 years instead of 18 years. ""I have seen other cases (under the same section) where the accused received a prison sentence of less than 18 years. ""Please give these young accused a second chance because this case is not under Section 302 of the same Code for murder. It is true that the accused made a mistake, but they deserve a second chance,"" he said. Amer Hamzah said both of his clients helped Zulfarhan to obtain treatment, medicine, and food following the incident. He said the prosecution might argue that such behaviour indicates that the accused knew they were committing an offence. ""However, the argument fails to prove that the accused had the intent to murder by causing the victim's death. In fact, the accused's actions after the incident indicate otherwise,"" he said. On Nov 2, 2021, High Court judge Datuk Azman Abdullah sentenced the five, including Mohamad Shobirin Sabri, to 18 years' jail after they were found guilty of causing the death of Zulfarhan without intent. The judge sentenced them under a lesser charge after finding that the common intention and abetment of the sixth accused caused injuries to Zulfarhan, but there was no intent to murder. The former students, then aged 21, had committed the offence at the Jebat Hostel Block, UPNM, between 2.30am and 5.30am on May 21, 2017, and in the same room between 1.30am and 4.30am on May 22, the same year.

Manoharan needs to attend another case at the Court of Appeal on that date. The court then fixed July 1 and 2 to hear the case. On Feb 21, Manoharan said the defence sent the (representation) letter on the grounds that the charges faced by the former cop were trivial. The offence is alleged to have occurred near a parking lot of a shopping mall in Brickfields at 5.26pm on June 16. She was charged under Section 268 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum fine of RM400 upon conviction. c On June 26 last year, Sheila, who has since been suspended from the force, was charged with making criminal threats with an intention to intimidate a 69-year-old woman at a restaurant in Taman Sri Gombak, Gombak, around noon on June 15. The charge under Section 506 of the Penal Code carries a maximum penalty of two years' jail and a fine if convicted. Sheila was also charged under Section 509 of the Penal Code with insulting the modesty of 41-year-old Lance Corporal Abdul Arif Farhan Abdul Raz. The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment and a fine if convicted. Subsequently, Sheila was accused of intimidating a male police officer with the rank of lance corporal with intent to insult his modesty at 1.25pm at the same place and date of the previous charges."

Selangor tops in sex crimes for past three years,Bernama,"May 15, 2024 @ 4:45pm","SHAH ALAM: Selangor recorded the highest number of sexual crimes in the country over the past three years, with 90 per cent of the perpetrators being locals. Bukit Aman's Sexual, Women and Child Investigation Division (D11) principal assistant director SAC Siti Kamisah Hasan, attributed Selangor's highest sexual crime rate in the past three years to factors such as population density, economic activities, the pressure of living and widespread internet access. She noted that Selangor, as a developed state bordered by Negri Sembilan, Kuala Lumpur and Perak, facilitated the entry of residents from outside, thereby contributing to the state's crime rate. ""Selangor, as a developed state with widespread internet access, has numerous facilities such as universities and prisons, and several sexual crimes are also reported here. ""Johor follows closely, with similar contributing factors, particularly its high population,"" she said during a townhall meeting at the Selangor Contingent Police Headquarters which was also attended by State police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan. However, Siti Kamsiah did not provide detailed statistics or the exact number of sexual crime cases recorded in Selangor. Regarding the 90 per cent of sexual crime perpetrators who were locals, she said investigations revealed that the perpetrators were known to the victims, with some being family members, friends and individuals in positions of trust such as teachers. ""Statistics show that the majority of sexual crime cases involve individuals in the B40 category, often due to economic pressures and unsuitable home environments,"" she said.

""Telecommunication devices and the internet facilitate this process, with introductions, chatting, and home visits (e-hailing services) making it easier for them to meet,"" she said during the Townhall Discussion of the Selangor Contingent Police 2024, held here today. The Community Welfare Responsibility Programme, which has been ongoing for years, was also attended by the Selangor Police Chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan. Siti Kamsiah explained that children were among the groups most easily drawn to and influenced by social media and seeking content in the online world. ""When they give a 'like,' it can attract public attention. There is also a stigma that children can attract someone, and they become a source of pride... I see that self-control is lacking,"" she said. She also mentioned that in efforts to address this issue, parents should not only educate but also monitor their children's behaviour, especially in the use of gadgets and monitor how they navigate the internet. ""The learning process at home is unavoidable. Parents must educate, control, and be aware of the risks in their children's environment. We can no longer rely solely on physical movements outside the home to prevent crimes, as crimes often start at home,"" she said. At the same time, Siti Kamsiah confirmed that Selangor was the highest contributor to sexual crime cases compared to other states in the past three years, with 90 per cent involving locals. ""Selangor is the highest state and the number of cases is far higher compared to other states. Among the factors are its population, proximity to other states' borders such as Negri Sembilan, Kuala Lumpur, and Perak. So, it leads to more access to Selangor. ""After Selangor, it's Johor... it's all based on population density and economic activities. The B40 group faces unstable economic conditions, educational neglect, household conditions and divorce,"" she said."
2 ex-officials of Kelantan water company among 4 nabbed by MACC [NSTTV],Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"May 15, 2024 @ 3:45pm","KOTA BARU: Two former senior officers of a Kelantan water company were among four people arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) over a probe into a failed tube wells project in the state.

""These wells are supposed to work to supply sufficient water to the people but preliminary investigations found that these wells could not produce the optimal amount of water,"" said the source. ""This is likely caused by corruption and malpractices in the implementation of the project."" MACC also seized the suspects' mobile phones and documents. When contacted, MACC Chief Commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki confirmed the arrests. The case is being investigated under Section 16 of the MACC Act for corruption. The suspects will be brought to the Kota Baru Sessions Court tomorrow for remand."

KLIA customs officer charged with 43 counts of corruption [NSTTV],Ahmad Hasbi,"May 15, 2024 @ 3:01pm","SEREMBAN: A customs officer was today slapped with 43 charges of accepting bribes amounting to RM69,350  in return for not inspecting a company's lorries at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Cargo terminal. The accused, Mohammad Zyed Ibrahim, 41, however pleaded not guilty to all the charges before Sessions Court Judge Meor Sulaiman Ahmad Tarmizi. According to the charges, the accused, as a Grade WK41 Customs Officer on duty at the KLIA Customs Department, had corruptly obtained for himself a bribe amounting to a total of RM69,350 from the owner of a company through an online transfer to the accused's bank account. The bribe was an incentive not to check the lorries belonging to the company that transports goods out of the KLIA Cargo Terminal. The act was carried out from Sept 16,  2017 to Jan 6, 2022 at a bank branch near Jalan Besar, Nilai. He was charged under Section 17(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 [Act 694] which is punishable under Section 24(1) of the same Act. According to the act, any person who commits an offence under sections 16, 17, 20, 21, 22 and 23 shall on conviction be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 20 years. They can also be fined not less than five times the amount or value of the bribe, if the bribe can be assessed or is of a monetary nature, or RM10,000 whichever is higher. The prosecution team consisting of MACC deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Asraf Mohamed Tahir, Nurul Atiqah Mohamad Alias and Mohd Afif Ali objected to any bail being given to the accused. ""It is clear that the accused's actions are a betrayal of the community and a negative image for the Customs Department. Corruption is also a serious offence and the accused is also a flight risk,"" they said. This is because, the accused never contacted or surrendered to the MACC even though a wanted notice was aired in the local media, and it took 65 days to track down the accused before he was arrested in Bintulu, Sarawak, on May 7. The accused's lawyer, Muhamad Aizat Fakri appealed for his client to be given a reasonable amount of bail on the grounds that he is a single father of a five-year-old. He said the accused was willing to be subjected to additional conditions and applied for a bail of RM10,000. The court then decided not to grant any bail because it took into account the risk of the accused escaping based on the record of the investigation. The court set June 14 for mention of the case."

Soosaimanicckam, a graduate cadet officer, was pronounced dead at the Armed Forces Hospital in Lumut on May 19, 2018. Last year, the Ipoh Coroner's Court delivered an open verdict during the inquest into the cadet officer's death to ascertain the cause. Coroner Ainul Shahrin Mohamad determined that the cause of Soosaimanicckam's death, which occurred during cadet training at KD Sultan Idris, was pulmonary edema.

"Police inspector sentenced to jail, fine over corruption",Ersie Anjumin,"May 14, 2024 @ 9:27pm","KOTA KINABALU: A police inspector convicted of two corruption charges had one of his convictions set aside in the Court of Appeal here today. Yugeswaran Surinaraina, 34, however, still needs to serve two years imprisonment plus RM10,000 in default two months' jail for the other charge. This was his final appeal after he lost in his previous bid at the High Court on Oct 15, 2021. Court of Appeal justices Datuk Ravinthran N. Paramaguru, Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali, and Datuk Dr Choo Kah Sing unanimously allowed Yugeswaran's appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence on the first charge. However, the court dismissed Yugeswaran's appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence on the second charge. Yugeswaran was found guilty by the Sessions Court on May 14, 2019 on two counts under Section under Section 17(a) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009, which carries a jail term of up to 20 years, and a fine of five times the amount involved, or RM10,000, whichever is higher. The court imposed two years imprisonment and fined RM10,000 in default four months' jail for each charge. The imprisonment terms are torun concurrently. The first count stated that Yugeswaran, who was an investigating officer in a cheating case is accused of receiving RM2,000 from a man as an inducement to keep the former's subordinate quiet pertaining to syabu use by his son, who was also being investigated for cheating. The offence took place on Jan 17, 2016 between 10am and 1am at the Sandakan police headquarters. On the second count, Yugeswaran had received another bribe of RM2,000 from the man as an inducement to close the cheating case involving his son. The offence took place between 5pm and 5.20pm on Jan 21, 2016 at a parking lot near a restaurant in Bandar Maju, Sandakan. Counsel Datuk N. Sivananthan represented the appellant while deputy public prosecutor Zaki Asraf Zubir appeared for the prosecution as respondent. It was learnt that the appellant had paid the fine."
Chegubard slapped with gag order in court cases linked to King,Dawn Chan,"May 14, 2024 @ 4:36pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court today issued a gag order barring Bersatu information committee member Badrul Hisham Shaharin from making statements on his ongoing defamatory case linked to His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, King of Malaysia. Judge K. Muniandy, in his brief grounds of judgement, ruled so after allowing the prosecution's application to review the decision of a Sessions Court which denied the gag order. ""The gag order refused by the SCJ (Sessions Court judge) is found to be improper by this court and pursuant to Section 325(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, this court in its exercise of revisionary jurisdiction allows the application for criminal revision. ""(And) Pursuant to Section 316(c) of the Code, reverse the said order by the SCJ. In the premise, pursuant to inherent jurisdiction of this court, the gag order is now made as supplemental to the order of bail granted to the respondent accused pending his trial,"" he said in his ruling today. The judge said any comments on the charge or the impending proceeding in the trial would be sub-judice and also an affront to the administration of justice, the rational being that the stream of justice shall not be sullied. He said it was best if the trial judge hears the case in accordance with the rule of law and procedure so that both the respondent accused as well as the prosecution obtains justice. ""It is as they deserve without heeding to any statement, comment and criticisms which may be levelled against the case in its entirety, which includes the charge and the proceeding that has to follow. ""The legal principles cited, pertains the sanctity of the trial which has to be preserved at all costs. ""As the charge signifies, which is pursuant to Section 500 read with Section 499 of the Penal Code, its rationale is to prevent any imputation which will harm the reputation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong,"" said the judge. He said unlike a civil case where the aggrieved party is in a position to apply for an injunction to prevent and restrain the offender from repeating the defamatory station, such an avenue is not available to the prosecution in a criminal proceeding. ""As once the matter reaches the court, the court takes over conduct of the case to ensure that justice is not compromised both for the prosecution and the accused person. ""Institution of a contempt proceeding or the like is a matter to be taken care of eventually when the need arises. ""Thus, until then the freshness of issues to be ventilated at the trial, as well as sanctity of the trial, has to be preserved by the court,"" he ruled. Separately, High Court judge Datuk Azhar Abdul Hamid dismissed the prosecution's similar application for a gag order for Badrul Hisham's sedition case. The judge said he agreed with Badrul Hisham's submissions that there was no strong reason to review the SCJ's decision. ""However, the respondent is reminded that the freedom of speech in accordance with Article 10 of the Federal Constitution has a limit and not something absolute,"" he said. The prosecution was represented by deputy public prosecutor Datin Kalmizah Salleh while Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali stood for Badrul Hisham. On April 29, Badrul Hisham,45, claimed trial to two counts of making seditious remarks and defaming His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim King of Malaysia. According to the charge, Badrul Hisham was accused of making defamatory statements where he had reason to believe that it would damage the reputation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The alleged offence took place at the Istana Negara at 6pm on Jan 22. The charge under Section 500 of the Penal Code which provides for a maximum jail term of two years or a fine, or both, upon conviction. He also faced another charge of making a seditious post at Taman Bukit Cheras at 12.15pm on April 6."

"Leave my family alone, Loh tells MAIPs",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 14, 2024 @ 3:53pm","PUTRAJAYA: Single mother Loh Siew Hong wants the Perlis Islamic Religious and Malay Customs Council (MAIPs) to 'leave her family alone' as they had suffered enough over the past four years. The 36-year-old woman said her four children had endured enough pain and suffering after their father, who converted to Islam in 2020, unilaterally changed their religion. Loh, who could not hold back her tears said this when met after the Federal Court's proceedings which affirmed the lower court's decision to dismiss MAIPs's judicial review challenging the children's conversion today. ""I do not want them (MAIPs) to disturb us... leave me alone. ""I am very happy with today's decision,"" she said.  Earlier, the top court dismissed leave (permission) by MAIPs and the Perlis government to review the lower court's decision in dismissing their case in January this year. This means, the Court of Appeal's decision that the unilateral conversion by Loh's husband M. Nagahswaran was illegal will be taken as the final decision. In today's proceeding, the three-member Federal Court bench led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat ruled that MAIPs' argument had already been addressed in a landmark decision in 2018 regarding Indira Gandhi's unilaterally converted children. ""There is no reason for this court to revisit the issues raised in this case. ""The Federal Court judgment in Indira Gandhi is binding throughout the nation,"" she said. Meanwhile, counsel Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla who appeared for MAIPs expressed acceptance of the top court's ruling with an open heart. When asked whether they would file a review of the court's ruling, the senior lawyer said he would leave the decision to his client. ""There are provisions for review, but I will not advise my client to keep on filing for review after review for matters like this. ""We are at the leave stage, where the court could have granted leave but did not, so what is there to review?"" he added. On Jan 10, the appellate court allowed Loh's appeal against the High Court's decision which previously stated that there was no evidence indicating that her children had ceased practicing Islam while under her care. Judge Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail said the High Court failed to address two pertinent issues in the judicial review proceedings, which are whether unilateral conversion is lawful and whether Section 117b of the Perlis Enactment Four is unconstitutional as it contradicts Article 12(4) of the Federal Constitution. ""The failure of the High Court judge to answer these two issues is a clear direction that is tantamount to error of law. ""On the issue of unilateral conversion, we are bound by the decision in Indira Gandhi which held that consent of both parents must be obtained before minor children can be converted to another religion. ""In this case, it is not disputed that the appellant mother did not consent to the three children's conversion to Islam,"" she said. Loh's three children were converted to Islam by her ex-husband without her consent in 2019, and she had contesting its legality. She had sought to secure a declaration affirming her children's Hindu status, arguing they were not legally capable of adopting Islam without her authorisation. Additionally, she sought to overturn the conversion registration dated July 7, 2020, issued by the registrar."

Court of Appeal dismisses appeal of 5 former UPNM students against conviction over injury to navy cadet,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 14, 2024 @ 1:47pm","PUTRAJAYA: The Court of Appeal today dismissed the appeal of five former National Defence Universiti (UPNM) cadets against their conviction and three-year prison sentence for injuring navy cadet Zulfarhan Osman Zulkarnain seven years ago. A panel of three judges led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail and sitting with Mohamed Zaini Mazlan and Datuk Azmi Ariffin made the decision after the five withdrew their respective appeals recently. The five are – Muhammad Akmal Zuhairi Azmal, Muhammad Azamuddin Mad Sofi, Muhammad Najib Mohd Razi, Muhammad Afif Najmudin Azahat and Abdoul Hakeem Mohd Ali. Counsel Amer Hamzah Arshad, who appeared for all the appellants, said their appeal had become academic and was no longer relevant as all of them had already been serving their prison sentences since 2021.   Deputy public prosecutor K. Mangai did not object to the withdrawal. He said all of them were now focusing their appeal on the conviction and 18-year jail sentence under Section 304 of the Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On Nov 2, 2021, High Court judge Datuk Azman Abdullah sentenced the five, including Mohamad Shobirin Sabri, to 18 years jail after they were found guilty of causing the death of Zulfarhan without intent. The judge sentenced them under a lesser charge after finding that the common intention and abetment of the sixth accused had caused injuries to Zulfarhan but there was no intention of murder. Judge Azman also sentenced the six, except for Shobirin, along with 12 others, to three years jail after finding them guilty of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Zulfarhan to coerce a confession from him that he had stolen a laptop. The others guilty of causing grievous hurt to Zulfarhan were ordered to serve their jail term from the date of sentencing.

"Tycoon Halim Saad fails in suit against Dr M, 2 others over Renong takeover [NSTTV]",Dawn Chan,"May 14, 2024 @ 12:10pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and two others succeeded in their bid to strike out tycoon Tan Sri Halim Saad's suit against them over losses he allegedly suffered after the acquisition of Renong Berhad and United Engineers Malaysia Berhad (UEM) shares by the government 23 years ago. High Court judicial commissioner Dr Suzana Muhamad Said allowed the application of Dr Mahathir, former finance minister II Tan Sri Nor Mohamed Yakcop and the government, ruling that there was a basis for the limitation of time (statute of limitation). Halim, the former executive chairman and director of Renong, filed the suit against the trio on Aug 2 last year. Judicial commissioner Dr Suzana said the court found that there was also a suit filed by Halim against Khazanah Nasional Berhad, Nor Mohamed and the government on the same matter in 2013 which had been disposed of. She said whatever issues raised then were bound by the principle of res judicata and limitation of time. ""There is a reason why there is a limitation clause. It is to put a stop to unnecessary action being taken especially after a period of time. ""To me, the occasion was in 2001. It has been more than 20 years and also considering that fact the suit in 2013, after more than 10 years, then only this instant case is being brought forward to the court,"" she ruled. In 2013, the High Court struck out Halim's suit to claim RM1.8 billion in damages for selling his shares, on the grounds that it was filed beyond the six-year time frame allowed under the Limitation Act 1953. Judicial commissioner Dr Suzana said consequently, there was no necessity for the court to consider Halim's application to refer two constitutional questions to the Federal Court. She ordered Halim to pay RM10,000 in costs to the trio. Halim was represented by counsels Datuk Malik Imtiaz Sarwar and Surendra Ananth. Senior Federal Counsel Ahmad Hanir Hambaly represented Dr Mahathir, Nor Mohamed and the government. The plaintiff, Halim, in his statement of claim, contended that the first and second defendants (Dr Mahathir and Nor Mohamed) had acted on behalf of the government and were the prime movers in respect of the said compulsory acquisition and deprivation in 2001. Halim claimed that Renong's 37.92 per cent shares in UEM belonged to him. He had intended to make a general offer on UEM, either through Renong or jointly with Renong, to take it private as a subsidiary of Renong. This would have enabled Halim, by virtue of his Renong shares, to acquire control and have full ownership of UEM through Renong. ""The plaintiff was, however, directed by Dr Mahathir through Nor Mohamed, not to proceed with the takeover as the government wanted to acquire all the shares in UEM through a designated entity, Khazanah Nasional Bhd. ""The plaintiff was also directed to exit both UEM and Renong, both as shareholder and director including in subsidiaries of the said companies,"" claimed Halim. Halim also claimed that this had required him to cede his control over Renong and UEM to the government and to eventually dispose of his Renong shares at a loss. The plaintiff claimed he complied with Dr Mahathir's directive as the latter was the then prime minister and finance minister. He claimed that this had breached his rights as enshrined in Article 8 and Article 13 of the Federal Constitution."
Deepak Jaikishan: Azmin's 'telur Deepak' remarks cut deep and spoiled my birthday bash [NSTTV],Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 13, 2024 @ 5:50pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Businessman Deepak Jaikishan said Datuk Seri Azmin Ali's infamous remarks of 'telur Deepak' (Deepak's egg) severely tarnished his reputation and integrity as a businessman. He said Azmin's remark which was uttered during a ceramah last year was a blatant lie and ruined his birthday celebration, which should have been a joyous occasion. ""I was supposed to be busy cutting my birthday cake when I heard about Azmin's statement against me. ""It was a cruel thing for him (Azmin) to lie about me on stage like that... it hurt me,"" he said before High Court judicial commissioner Leong Wai Hong today. Deepak said this when testifying as a witness in J&E Advance Tech Sdn Bhd's defamation suit against Azmin over the latter's allegation that the company was awarded the project to import eggs from India via direct negotiation by the government. During examination-in-chief by counsel Weera Premananda, who appeared for the company, Deepak said that there were no instances of open tender or direct negotiation involved, as the government had issued an import license to the company to bring in eggs from India. He said Azmin's insinuation that J&E obtained a permit to import eggs because of his friendship with Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, the wife of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, was also an unpleasant remark. ""It is a vile statement, especially for me, coming from someone like Azmin... especially with him repeating the word 'eggs'. ""When he said 'Rosmah's friend'... it was evil because everyone knows she is my biggest enemy. She destroyed my business,"" he said. Earlier, Deepak's younger brother Rajesh, who is also J&E general manager, testified that Azmin's allegations were untrue because there were no direct negotiations with the government to obtain the egg import license. Rajesh said his brother has no legal ties with the company and is only familiar with it due to their familial relationship. ""Deepak has no relationship with the plaintiff (J&E) or was he involved in the importing of the eggs from India. The defendant's statements are wholly untrue and unsubstantiated."" Rajesh said the company had made a transparent application to the Malaysian Veterinary Services Department for approval due to the shortage of eggs in the country. ""Stringent requirements were fulfilled by J&E in relation to the regulations by Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) in India and likewise by the Department of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry and Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services Department (MAQIS) in Malaysia. ""As a consequence of the defendant's careless statements alleging that the eggs were of poor and/or subpar quality, the plaintiff has suffered loss in business,"" he said. The company is seeking general, exemplary and aggravated damages from Azmin. It is also seeking a court order to stop Azmin from repeating the impugned statement. On March 12, last year, during a PN ceramah at Pas' base in Taman Melewar, Azmin alleged that the government had awarded the project to import eggs from India via direct negotiations. He claimed that the direct award of the contract contradicted the promise of an open tender process made by the unity government led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim. Azmin also claimed that the minister in charge, Datuk Seri Mohamad Sabu, had taken the businessman involved in his visit to India recently. On Feb 28, last year, Mohamad was reported to have said that only one company was permitted to import eggs from India and that the move was taken to deal with the lack of supply of eggs in the local market. However, when answering a question from Putrajaya MP Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin in Parliament, Mohamad admitted that the company that imported eggs from India did not go through the open tender process because it was a ""special case""."

Magistrate Atiqah Mohamed@Mohamad Saim meted out the sentence on Ganasean K. Ananda, 51, after he pleaded guilty to the offence. The court ordered the building manager to serve a month in jail if he failed to pay the fine. The charge sheet read that Ganasean had impersonated the state's top cop to cheat an individual at 8.35pm in Bandar Baru Sentul on May 6.

The judge ordered the mother of two to serve 40 days in jail if she fails to pay the fine. On both charges, Nur Mastisha was charged with accepting RM3,000 on two occasions without favour in return from a man whom she knows has relations to her official duties. She committed the offences at 8pm and 8.05pm on Oct 1 and 12, 2022 at the Kuala Lumpur police contingent headquarters and a petrol station in Cheras respectively.

In mitigation, Nur Mastisha, who was unrepresented, pleaded that throughout her 19 years service with the force, she had never faced disciplinary or criminal action. ""This is my first offence and I take it as a test for me. ""I ask for a lower fine as I have to support my children and I have RM4,500 monthly debts to settle. ""It would not be easy for me to get a new job,"" she said. The facts of the case read that Nur Mastisha had offered to solve a sexual offence case without initiating an investigation and solicited the sum from a man whose son was a suspect. She had informed the man that his son would be charged in court and had told him to prepare the sum and the dates of the handover. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission then launched an operation to trap Nur Mastisha. Deputy public prosecutor Nurul Atiqah Mohamad Alias urged the court to impose a RM10,000 fine on the accused as a lesson.

""It was proven that she had solicited the money for herself to not take action against a sexual offence.

""The lack of integrity among certain officials within financial institutions is also a cause of this problem,"" he told BH. On the STRs, Zamri said reporting institutions, including lawyers, money changers, accountants, real estate agents, and company secretaries among others are supposed to file STRs in line with the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing, and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act (AMLATFPUAA). He said this was crucial as the people in these professions are on the ""front lines"" and can detect suspicious activities early on and report them to the authorities. Recently, Bank Negara Malaysia highlighted the failure of financial institutions to conduct customer due diligence and sanctions screening of customers. This, the central bank said, led to increased exposure and prevalence of money laundering and terrorism financing activities in the country. Zamri said the failure to conduct customer due diligence opened the doors to crime, including in the opening of mule accounts. He said recent probes found that dummy accounts were being used to channel bribes to various enforcement agency personnel. ""This issue is not only limited to dummy account issues but is also linked to approval of financial loans to unqualified individuals and companies. ""In return for approving these loans, these officials will receive commissions paid through third parties managing the loans. ""This action directly leads to losses for financial institutions when loan repayments fail to be settled by unqualified borrowers,"" he said. Zamri said financial institutions and reporting agencies must cooperate with MACC and other enforcement agencies to obtain information for investigations. In this regard, Mohamad Zamri emphasized that cooperation by the Compliance Division of financial institutions and reporting institutions needs to be improved to assist the MACC and enforcement agencies in obtaining information during investigations. ""These reporting institutions are not only focused on financial institutions but also involve other institutions as listed in the First Schedule of the AMLATFPUAA,"" he said."
Immigration busts syndicate falsifying foreign passports [NSTTV],Iylia Marsya Iskandar,"May 13, 2024 @ 11:35am","PUTRAJAYA: The Immigration Department has detained a Bangladeshi man suspected to be the mastermind of a syndicate falsifying passport details, believed to be the first of its kind. The syndicate, which has been operating for two years, falsified the passport details of Bangladeshis and other foreigners with expired passports by tearing the front page of the passport and sticking a new page with ""updated"" expiry dates. The syndicate would charge around RM1,000 to RM1,500 per person for the falsified documents. The passports with forged details would then be used by the foreigners to obtain Foreign Workers Medical Examination Monitoring Agency (Fomema) clearance. The syndicate had charged RM600 to RM1,000 per person for getting Fomema clearance. Immigration Department director-general Datuk Ruslin Jusoh said the 38-year-old mastermind, known as ""Ofu Bhai"", was detained without a valid travel document alongside his partner, a 40-year-old Filipino who had overstayed. In a raid at premises in Kajang on Friday, he said, the department seized a set of computers and 211 expired passports of which 199 were from Bangladesh. He said others included passports from India, the Philippines and Indonesia. They also seized 31 front-page sheets with falsified documents, 144 sheets of Fomema documents, various tools for falsifying documents and RM16,000 in cash. ""The passports are real passports but only the sheets are fake with no security features. ""They would use a sort of oil to tear off the front page, print the new sheet with an updated expiry date and stick on the new one to deceive the authorities. ""The cash we seized was not much — only RM16,000 — but we believe that they would have more as most of the money would have been transferred online to avoid being traced,"" said Ruslin, adding that the department has been investigating the syndicate for three weeks. He added that the department was widening its investigations and looking into the syndicate's other networks in the country. ""We are not only targeting those in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the Klang Valley but also looking into the possibility that this also happens in Johor as there have been cases of falsified documents there as well,"" he said. Ruslin said both of the suspects have been remanded for 14 days at the Putrajaya Immigration depot to facilitate investigations under Section 55D of the Immigration Act 1956/63 and Section 12(1)(a) of the Passport Act 1966. ""The foreigners don't want to go back to their hometowns so they try to look for unlawful ways (to stay here). ""We will continue combatting issues of falsifying passport documents,"" he said."

Former SRC director says he doesn't know why government dropped suit against him,Dawn Chan,"May 6, 2024 @ 6:08pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former SRC International Sdn Bhd director Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi told the High Court today that he did not enter into any deal with the government to drop him as a defendant in the company's US$1.18 billion civil suit against him. Shahrol Azral, testifying as a third party in SRC International's suit against former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak and former chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil, said he had no knowledge why the company had struck him off from the list of defendants. ""I do not know and I did not ask why I was dropped,"" he said when cross examined by Najib's counsel, Harvinderjit Singh. Harvinderjit said the present case was filed by SRC International in May 2021, but later, a notice of discontinuance to drop the suit against Shahrol Azral was served. Shahrol Azral replied yes when Harvinderjit put to him that the civil action was discontinued at the time when he was giving evidence in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) trial. Asked if he had resigned from SRC International because there was something fishy going on in the company, Shahrol Azral said no. In 2020, Shahrol Azral denied making a deal with the Malaysia Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) with the prosecution to testify against Najib to save his own neck. He had said he had never been detained or remanded by any enforcement agency from the day the 1MDB scandal broke but was called to assist investigations as a witness in the case by police and MACC officers. Meanwhile, Shahrol Azral said Nik Faisal did not consult him about the RM4 million Retirement Fund Inc loan.  ""He did not consult me but he told me after the fact that it was what was already decided or discussed with the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) or Jho Low.""He told me this verbally. ""I took it that this had been discussed between the PMO and Nik Faisal. It looked like a direction they were working on and I did not have objections,"" he said, referring to fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho, better known as Jho Low. Shahrol Azral, however, said it was something the SRC International board should have deliberated on first, especially when 1MDB was supposed to be the guarantor for the RM4 billion loan and for SRC itself to look at financing avenues. SRC, under its new management, filed the suit in May 2021, claiming that Najib had committed a breach of trust and power abuse, personally benefited from the company's funds and misappropriated the said funds.It also sought a court declaration that Najib is responsible for the company's losses due to his breach of duties and trust. It also want Najib to pay back the RM42 million in losses that they have suffered.Najib, 70, has been serving a jail sentence at the Kajang Prison since Aug 23, 2022, after being convicted of misappropriating RM42 million in SRC International funds. He then filed a petition for a royal pardon on Sept 2, 2022.The Pardons Board in January reduced Najib's jail term from 12 years to six, with the fine cut to RM50 million from RM210 million. The trial before High Court judge Datuk Ahmad Fairuz Zainol Abidin continues."

Chegubard charged under Sedition Act again,,No published date found,"JOHOR BARU: Bersatu information committee member Badrul Hisham Shaharin was today charged in the Sessions Court here for publishing seditious material on social media on Friday. The 45-year-old, more popularly known as Chegubard, claimed trial to the charge immediately after it was read before judge Rasidah Roslee. He was alleged to have committed the offence — regarding the purported casino project in Forest City which has since been denied — via his Facebook account with the handle Che GuBard, at Mutiara Villa, Bukit Bintang in Kuala Lumpur, at 6.30pm on April 26. The charge was framed under Paragraph 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948, which carries a punishment of a maximum fine of RM5,000 or a jail term of up to three years or both. Deputy public prosecutors Datuk Masri Mohd Daud, Abdul Ghafar Ab Latif, Abdul Malik Ayob and Nadia Mohd Izhar recommended bail of RM20,000 with one surety.  ""Apart from, that we ask for the accused to be barred from making any comment or statement on any social media platform until the completion of the case. This is necessary so that the case is not jeopardised.""

""My client has been charged with similar offences in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court, with bail set there at RM10,000 with one surety. ""The request for my client to be barred from making any comment or statement is also too vague and appears to be more like an injunction. Such an order would be unconstitutional as, under Article 10 (of the Federal Constitution), Malaysian citizens have the freedom to discuss any matter openly as long as it is not against the law,"" he said. The court then set bail of RM10,000 with one surety. Rasidah also denied the prosecution's application for a gag order on Badrul Hisham, saying that the team had failed to produce any evidence or written affidavit proving that the accused or any other quarters would jeopardise justice during the trial. The court then set June 24 for remention of the case for the submission of documents and for trial dates to be set. Present in court as an observer was Pasir Gudang member of parliament Hassan Abdul Karim, who is a lawyer. He was also there as a show of support for Badrul Hisham. In Kuala Lumpur yesterday, Badrul Hisham was charged with two counts under the Sedition Act for making seditious remarks and defaming the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. He had claimed trial to both charges as soon as they were read before Sessions judge Siti Aminah Ghazali."

[Updated] Federal Court dismisses woman's appeal to challenge religious status,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 3, 2024 @ 3:43pm","   In delivering the decision, Abang Iskandar said he and Abu Bakar were of the view that the appeal had no merit. ""The Court of Appeal did not err in its decision to restore the woman's religious status. ""Therefore, the lower court's decision is upheld, and the woman's appeal is dismissed. ""The court did not issue any order for costs,"" he said. On Jan 13, last year, an appellate court overturned the High Court's decision on Dec 21, 2021, which nullified the woman's conversion to Islam by her Muslim-convert mother. Court of Appeal judge Datuk Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali when delivering the majority decision said the civil court did not have the power to hear cases involving renunciation. He said the woman came to civil court after her renunciation bid was rejected at the Syariah Court. Meanwhile, Lim in her dissenting judgment, said the appellant's religion was changed to Islam when she was five years old on May 17, 1991. ""The woman was underage and had not reached puberty when her religion was changed by her mother, which is clearly invalid. ""Her (the appellant) identity remains according to the constitution, which stipulates the religion at birth,"" she said. The woman, born in Selangor to a Hindu father and a Buddhist mother who later converted to Islam, filed an originating summons in the Shah Alam High Court on May 10, 2021. She was seeking a declaration that she is not a Muslim and wanted the National Registration Department (NRD) to remove the word ""Islam"" from her identity card. She claimed that her mother converted her to Islam in 1991 at the Selangor Islamic Religious Department. At the material time, her parents were in the midst of a divorce. After the divorce, her mother married a Muslim man in 1993 while her father died in an accident in 1996. The woman said despite her conversion into Islam, she continued to profess the Hindu religion and that her mother and stepfather allowed her to practice Hinduism— the religion she was initially practiced. In 2013, the woman filed an application at the Kuala Lumpur Shariah High Court seeking to renounce Islam but her application for renunciation was dismissed in 2017, and she was ordered to attend a series of counselling sessions. The Shariah Appeals Court also upheld the ruling. The woman then filed the suit in the Shah Alam High Court (civil) in 2021 and succeeded in getting a declaration that she is not a Muslim."
Fraudulent investment scheme victims risk losing right to recover losses - CCID,Bernama,"May 3, 2024 @ 3:30pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Individuals who have fallen victim to fraudulent investment schemes risk losing the right to recover their money even after going through the legal avenue. Federal police Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said this is due to the funds seized from the syndicate being determined as proceeds of illegal activities, and therefore, victims cannot be considered to have a legitimate legal interest in them. ""Evidence shows that they (investors) have voluntarily and without coercion deposited money into accounts that were instructed, to become investors in the VenusFX scheme and expect a return on the investment,"" he said during the CCID director's special media conference at Menara KPJ, here today. On April 24, the Federal Court allowed the prosecution's appeal to forfeit more than RM1.1 million from 79 investors in an illegal deposit taking scheme. A three-judge panel led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat also ordered that the funds be divested of their rights and channeled into government revenue. In light of this, Ramli cautioned the public against engaging in any unregistered investment schemes, especially those promoted through social media platforms and the like. When asked about potential scam victims seeking recourse, Ramli explained that such claims could be pursued through a request to investigative officers, though the ultimate decisions lie with the courts. Moreover, Ramli noted a recent surge in companies offering gold-based investments, a trend driven by current global economic uncertainty and currency fluctuations. ""Based on our investigations, many of these investment schemes end in deception and loss. For instance, if gold prices continue to rise, investors may sell for profit. However, companies may fail to meet gold redemption obligations, resulting in adverse effects for investors,"" he elaborated. Therefore, Ramli emphasised the need for a robust mechanism to monitor and regulate investment schemes, particularly those involving gold investments. ""Our department proposes that Bank Negara Malaysia establish more appropriate regulations and ensure that companies offering precious metal-based investments are duly registered with them. This is crucial to safeguard invested funds and mitigate the proliferation of fraudulent investment schemes,"" he stressed. – Bernama"

Rayer, nevertheless, said they respected the court's decision. Ramkarpal Singh said the grounds of Rofiah's judgment was based on the lines of the Attorney-General having unfettered discussion in instituting proceedings. Meanwhile, Lim said he would continue to fight to clear his name. Deputy Public Prosecutors Syed Faisal Syed Amir, Ashrof Adrin Kamarul and Shafiq Hasim prosecuted. Also appearing for the defence were Datuk V. Sithambaram, A Ruebankumar and Thandayuthabany Pillay.

Defamation suit against Rewcastle-Brown: Apandi ex-aide's failure to translate articles 'costs' her RM1m,Dawn Chan,"May 2, 2024 @ 8:00pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A former special officer to an ex-attorney-general today lost her RM100 million suit against Sarawak Report editor Clare Rewcastle Brown because she did not translate two allegedly defamatory articles into Bahasa Melayu. High Court judicial commissioner Datuk Raja Ahmad Mohzanuddin Shah Raja Mohzan ruled against retired Sessions Court judge Mable Sheela Muttiah in her suit over three articles, including a 2015 Sarawak Report titled, ""How AG's office connived to prevent a second postmortem on Kevin Morais - Exclusive Exposè"". Mabel was once a special officer to Tan Sri Mohamed Apandi Ali. Raja Ahmad Mohzanuddin said the plaintiff had failed to translate two of the three allegedly defamatory articles into Bahasa Melayu, a mandatory requirement for all pleadings filed in court. Raja Ahmad Mohzanuddin said the plaintiff had failed to translate two of the three allegedly defamatory articles into Bahasa Melayu, a mandatory requirement for all pleadings filed in court. He said the requirement for complete pleadings in Bahasa Melayu is tritely attributed to the language's supremacy as a national language. He said this is enshrined in Article 152 of the Constitution and Section 8 of the National Language Act 1963/67 and Order 92 Rule 1 of the Rules of Court 2012. He said the plaintiff made inferences about the meaning of the articles, but there was still no certified translation in Bahasa Melayu. He said he was bound by two Court of Appeal rulings. ""On this sole basis, I am therefore constrained to hold that the defect is so fundamental that it is not permissible for me to allow the plaintiff's claim as set forth in her amended statement of claim. ""As a result, the plaintiff's claim must fail,"" he said. Mabel was ordered to pay RM15,000 in costs to Rewcastle-Brown. Raja Ahmad Mohzanuddin said he would have awarded RM1 million in damages as one of the three articles was defamatory and injured Mabel's reputation. He said after carefully reviewing the parties' submissions, he concluded that the first article was clearly defamatory to the plaintiff. ""The article clearly suggested that the plaintiff was involved in a conspiracy of some kind at the highest level to cheat the family of the late Morais of their rights to a second independent post-mortem report. ""On the basis of the evidence presented to me, the article was published worldwide, which clearly damaged and gravely injured the plaintiff,"" he said. Mabel was represented by counsels Datuk David Gurupatham and R. Venothani, while Guok Ngek Seong and Phyllia Lim stood for Rewcastle-Brown."

Tengku Zafrul fails in bid to file affidavit on Najib's house arrest,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"May 2, 2024 @ 3:33pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz has failed in his bid to file an affidavit related to an addendum order by the previous King allowing former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. Judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh dismissed Tengku Zafrul's leave application to file affidavit to correct ""factual errors"" in another affidavit, which claimed that former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, granted house arrest to Najib. Senior federal counsel Ahmad Hanir Hambly who appeared for the Attorney-General's Chambers said there was no provision in the law that would enable the Investment Trade and Industry Minister to file his affidavit at this stage. ""The judge said Najib's case (judicial review) is still at leave (permission) stage. ""Amarjeet has yet to make his decision... he (Tengku Zafrul) can try again when the court allows leave on Najib's application,"" he said when met after the proceedings which was held in chambers today. Amarjeet previously fixed June 5 to deliver his decision on Najib's leave application. Najib's counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah later said he objected to Tengku Zafrul's application as the latter was not a party to the main suit. Tengku Zafrul was represented by lawyer Datuk Sunil Abraham. He declined to comment when approached. Earlier, the public was excluded from the hearing as the matter was taken into chambers. It was previously reported that Tengku Zafrul filed the application to enable him to submit an affidavit addressing the ""factual inaccuracies"" in Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi's affidavit supporting Najib's case. The Umno president had claimed that Tengku Zafrul showed him a copy of the addendum order on his phone on Jan 30, which he personally photographed or scanned from an original copy as shown to him by the former King. On Jan 29, the Federal Territories Pardons Board, which the then King presided over, halved Najib's 12-year jail sentence for abuse of power and criminal breach of trust in the SRC International case, and reduced his RM210 million fine to RM50 million. Najib in his judicial review application to the High Court on April 1, claimed the then King issued an addendum order — also on Jan 29 — allowing him to serve the remainder of his jail sentence under house arrest. He named the Home Minister, Prison Department commissioner general, Attorney-General (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents."

The premises had been converted into call centres to coerce their victims into investing in the fraudulent investments and employment, he added. He said the syndicate operated both online scams concurrently. Some of its members targeted foreigners who were enticed into investing in non-existent investments, while others engaged their victims into taking up online positions in made-up establishments.

They would also convince their victims to purchase international sim cards, while their alleged mode-of payment was via cryptocurrency. It is learnt once their victims fell for their ruse, the syndicate members will instruct them to download a link to access their fake investment portfolio site.

Cabinet approved letter of support on issuance of US$3 billion in bonds by 1MDB subsidiary,Rahmat Khairulrijal,No published date found,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Cabinet unanimously agreed to approve a letter of support for the issuance of US$3 billion in bonds by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB)'s subsidiary 1MDB Global Investment Bhd (1MDB GIL) in 2013. Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) senior officer Nur Aida Arifin said the then prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had attended a Cabinet meeting on March 13, 2013, where he presented a memo seeking ministerial approval. She said this when testifying under cross-examination by Najib's counsel Wan Azwan Aiman Wan Fakhruddin in the Najib's corruption trial for misappropriating millions of funds belonging to the sovereign state fund. Nur Aida also agreed with Wan Azwan Aiman's suggestion that Najib was merely performing his duties as the then finance minister and had no personal interest in the issuance of the bonds. Wan Azwan Aiman: My client's action of highlighting the risks associated with the bond issuance proved that he did not have any personal interest in the matter.  Nur Aida: I disagree. Wan Azwan Aiman: If my client had a personal interest in this bond issuance, he should have secured a much larger amount, twice the stated sum of US$3 billion. Nur Aida: I disagree. Nur Aida, when testifying on Jan 24, this year, said the funds (US$3 billion) were raised by Goldman Sachs through a bond issuance to develop the Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) project between 1MDB and Aabar Investment PJS. ""On March 19, 2013, the proceeds of the US$3 billion note issuance were finalised and transferred to the 1MDB GIL account at BSI SA, Lugano, Switzerland, with a total amount of US$ 2,721,000,000,"" she said. She said 1MDB former chief executive Mohd Hazem Rahman had made several requests to Najib to bring back these funds home to finance the needs of 1MDB, but was rejected by fugitive businessman Low Taek Jho or Jho Low. She said Low gave instructions that these funds should not be repatriated because they were intended for the use of Umno's election funds. ""Hazem had conveyed this matter to Najib's former principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias and 1MDB's chairman Tan Sri Che Lodin Wok Kamaruddin to bring the matter to Najib's attention. ""However, Najib did not permit the repatriation of these funds, and no clear reason was provided,"" she said. On Nov 18, 2021, former 1MDB non-executive director Tan Sri Ismee Ismail when testifying in the same trial revealed that the government had issued a letter of support acknowlegeding that 1MDB GIL would be raising USD$3 billion via a bond issuance which was to be paid in full in March 2023. The letter dated March 14, 2013, was signed by Najib, who was also the finance minister at that time. He said the letter had reflected the government's strong support to repay the USD$3 billion bond with interests. He also pointed out that the letter of support was issued rather expeditiously as the fundraising exercise was approved on March 12, 2013, while the letter was issued only two days after. Najib, 70, is facing four charges of using his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.3 billion from 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount. Hearing before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah continues."

Man who stabbed girlfriend to death escapes death penalty,Dawn Chan,"April 30, 2024 @ 3:12pm","PUTRAJAYA: A former construction company manager who murdered his Indonesian girlfriend by stabbing her 28 times six years ago was spared the death sentence by the Court of Appeal today. A three-judge panel chaired by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, in a unanimous decision, substituted the death penalty imposed on Sobri Abdul Wahab with a 30-year jail term and 12 strokes of the rotan. Hadhariah said the Shah Alam High Court did not err in its decision, adding that its conviction against Sobri, 46, was safe. ""There is no merit in Sobri's appeal and his plea of insanity at the time of the incident could not be proven. ""The conviction is upheld but the death sentence is replaced with 30 years' jail and 12 strokes of the rotan,"" she ruled.  She ordered him to serve the jail sentence from the date of his arrest on March 10, 2018. In mitigation, defence counsel K.A Ramu pleaded that his client was insane and was not under medication at the time of the incident. ""He could have fled the country if he was of sound mind after the murder,"" he said. Deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee objected to the plea. ""He behaved normally, and he was not medically insane,"" she said. On Dec 31, 2021, the Shah Alam High Court sentenced Sobri to death after finding him guilty of the murder. Judge Datuk Abd Halim Aman, in his judgment, said schizophrenia was not the cause of Sobri's action at the time of the incident. He said Sobri was aware that he committed the murder. He was charged with the murder of Gusnima, 38, at an apartment in Section U8, Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, between 6pm and 8pm on March 10, 2018. It was reported that prior to the incident, Sobri had gone to her house to ask her to marry him."

In his defence, Shahrul testified that he and Nurul Hazira had planned to commit suicide by drinking poison ""like Romeo and Juliet"". He claimed that Nurul Hazira forced him to drink the poison first. He alleged that he had passed out and when he woke up, she was already dead and he ran to a neighbour's house for help. He claimed that Nurul Hazira had told him that she was not in love with the man who proposed to her. She had instead asked Shahrul to marry her, but he had asked her to wait as he had no money.

"Two ex-cops's death sentence commuted, jailed 40 years for 'execution-style murder' of Indonesian mechanic",Dawn Chan,"April 30, 2024 @ 1:54pm","PUTRAJAYA: Two former policemen who were convicted for the murder of an Indonesian man in 2011 escaped the noose after the Federal Court today commuted their death sentence to a maximum of 40 years' jail. A three-judge panel led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, who sat with Justices Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, made the unanimous decision to set aside the death penalty. They ordered wheelchair-bound Corporal Ailias Yahaya, 70, and Lance Corporal Saiful Azlan Shah Abdullah, 60, to serve the sentence from the date of their arrest on Jan 22, 2006. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi objected to the duo's application to have their death sentences replaced with imprisonment. Ailias and Saiful Azlan, who were the applicants, were convicted of the murder of mechanic Yusrizal Yusuf by the Shah Alam High Court.  Tetralina described the crime committed by the duo as rare, as the deceased, from the time of his arrest to his death, was under their control. The deceased, she said, was arrested by the duo at the Sungai Pelong police station in Kuala Selangor following a report made against him. ""Ailias had told two prosecution witnesses that they could beat and vent their anger on the deceased when he was detained at the station's meeting room. ""The two had beaten, punched and kicked the deceased until he bled and there were blood stains on the room's wall, carpet and notice board. ""The applicants and a prosecution witness had brought the deceased, who was handcuffed, to Ladang Caledonia in a car. ""Saiful Azlan borrowed a pistol from an accused who had been acquitted and discharged. He ordered the deceased to alight from the car and kneel. ""He shot the deceased in his head thrice from behind while Ailias stood at the front, according to a prosecution witness. ""The shots were fired at close range between six to 10 feet and the shots were fired from a pistol which is government property belonging to the police. ""The applicants, as policemen, had abused their power and took the law into their own hands with the execution-style murder. ""On these grounds, the prosecution as respondent, requests for the application to be dismissed and for the death sentence to be upheld, If not, a maximum jail term should be imposed,"" she said. In reply, defence counsel Muhammad Fadhli Sutris said an imprisonment of 30 years was appropriate for the duo due to their age and poor health conditions. He said Ailias and Saiful joined the force in 1976 and 1982 respectively. They had received certificates of appreciation as well as excellence service awards for their work. He said it was not a rare case involving police, citing an example of former cop Mohamed Ya'cob Demyati who was convicted for the murder of singer Sabi'ul Malik Shafie, better known as Along Spoon. ""I humbly and respectfully ask the court to impose an imprisonment of 30 years on them. ""If they are given jail from 35 up to 40 years, I am not sure if they can survive, given their health condition,"" he said."

(UPDATED) Malaysian Bar challenges Pardons Board's decision on Najib's sentence reduction,,No published date found,"KUALA LUMPUR: The Malaysian Bar has filed a judicial review to challenge the Pardons Board over its decision to reduce former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak's prison term by half for his SRC International corruption conviction. In the application filed on April 26, the Malaysian Bar wanted the Federal Territories Pardons Board (FTPB)'s decision against Najib made on Jan 29 as unlawful, unconstitutional and void. The Malaysian Bar is also seeking a permanent injunction to restrain Najib, his servants, and agents from submitting any application for pardon until he publicly accepted responsibility and expressed repentance for his actions. Bar Council secretary Murshidah Mustafa, in her supporting affidavit claimed the FTPB's decision is a betrayal of the nation's trust and belief in investigating and prosecuting a corrupt figure who abused their position. She claimed FTPB's decision violates Article 8 (1) of the Federal Constitution by giving Najib priority or special treatment not afforded to other convicted prisoners who have been sentenced and applied for pardon. On March 16, the motion to file the judicial review was passed during the Malaysian Bar 78th Annual General Meeting (AGM). The newly-elected Malaysian Bar president Mohamed Ezri Abdul Wahab said 238 members supported the motion, with one member objecting. On Feb 2, the Federal Territories Pardons Board reduced Najib's fine as well as halved his 12-year jail term to six.

On Aug 23, 2022, the Federal Court upheld the conviction. The 70-year-old former Pekan member of Parliament is still facing four charges of abusing his position to obtain bribes totalling RM2.3 billion of 1MDB funds and 21 charges of money laundering involving the same amount."

""Both the applications are therefore allowed and the Sessions Court judgement was set aside and substituted with an order of acquittal and discharge without calling for them to enter their defence,"" he said. Bung Moktar and Zizie Izette were acquitted on Sept 7, last year after the High Court allowed their revision applications against the Sessions Court's decision in ordering them to enter their defence on the corruption charges.

The panel which comprised Justices Datuk Azmi Ariffin and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah also dismissed Mohd Azhud's appeal to overturn his conviction. The court, however, substituted the death sentence imposed on Mohd Azhud to 30 years' jail with 12 strokes of the rotan. In affirming Mohd Azhud's conviction for the murder offence, Justice Hadhariah said circumstantial evidence showed that it was the accused who murdered Ahmad Azam Ahmad. Mohd Azhud was appealing against the Feb 21, 2023 decision of the Ipoh High Court in sentencing him to death after finding him guilty for killing Ahmad Azam, 43, at a house in Lorong Mohd Ali Kampung Bahagia, Teluk Intan, Perak at 12.10 midnight on Aug 10, 2018. According to the facts of the case, a friend of Mohd Azhud who went to the house smelled a foul odour inside the house. He asked Mohd Azhud about foul odour and Mohd Azhud told him that there was a dead person. The friend said Mohd Azhud had said ""I am angry with him for a long time. I am upset. In his testimony from the dock, Mohd Azhud claimed that he had no intention of murdering his friend after both were involved in a fight. He said he hit his friend to protect himself as his friend was aggressive at that time. He claimed after the fight, he took ganja and slept for two days and when he woke up he realised the deceased was lying motionless on the floor and was not breathing. He said he had thought of digging a hole at the back of his house to bury Ahmad Azam's body but could not bring himself to do it so he decided to live together with the body. A post mortem report showed that the deceased sustained 23 external injuries and severe injuries to the head and chest. Lawyer Gurbachan Singh, Gobindeep Singh and Aashwini Rajan represented Mohd Azhud while deputy public prosecutor Zaki Ashraf Zubir appeared for the prosecution. – BERNAMA"
Foreigner who murdered Grab driver in 2019 gets 40 years jail,Ersie Anjumin,"April 29, 2024 @ 7:47pm","KOTA KINABALU: A Filipino man was sentenced to a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the rotan by the High Court here for murdering an e-hailing driver five years ago. Judge Leonard David Shim meted out the sentence on Arsit Indanan, 24, after finding that the prosecution had proven the case beyond reasonable doubt. Arsit, who is an undocumented migrant, was found guilty of murdering Mohammad Hanafiee Jaffar, 27, in a car between 4am and 5am on May 25, 2019, in Jalan Marabahai near here. In sentencing Arsit, Shim said that the accused's defence was an afterthought and mere denial. However, he also said that the court had taken into account the recent development of the law on the death penalty. The offence under Section 302 of the Penal Code provided for a death sentence upon conviction. But the Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Act 2023 (Act 846) allowed the court's discretion to either impose a death sentence or imprisonment of between 30 and 40 years, in addition to no fewer than 12 strokes of the rotan. In mitigation, lawyer Muhamad Amirul Amin told the court that Arsit was a first-time offender and he was suffering from mental health issues. Earlier, the prosecution comprising deputy public prosecutors Rozana Abdul Hadi, Azreen Yas Mohamad Ramli and Siti Hajar Mazlan, had asked for the death penalty due to the violent nature of the case. They highlighted the brutality of the murder, whereby the victim's neck was dislocated besides his body being found with stab and slash wounds. The accused also tried to dispose of the body and car at two locations. Hanafiee's body was found a few days after his murder, where it had begun to decompose. The post-mortem report also stated that the body had been partially eaten by animals. ""An innocent soul was lost during Ramadan of 2019. The deceased, that fateful morning, was only looking for extra income. Little did he know the ride he gave that morning was going to be his last. ""No parents should ever have to endure the pain of burying their child. No one can ever imagine the traumatic impact faced by the family in losing a young son and beloved one, especially in such a tragic and untimely death,"" said the prosecution. The prosecution had called 23 witnesses since the trial commenced on May 8 last year. Arsit was the sole witness in his own defence. Previously, he was jointly charged with his friend Amru Al Asy Japri, 27. However, on Jan 31 last year, Amru was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal by the same court."

"Kelantan cops on high alert for 'zombie drug' fentanyl, says state police chief",Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"April 29, 2024 @ 5:08pm","KOTA BARU: Police have been put on high alert for the possible entry of fentanyl, also known as the 'zombie drug', into Malaysia.   It has been attributed as the leading cause of death in the US among people aged 18 to 45. Kelantan police chief Datuk Muhamad Zaki Harun said he recently met with Thai parliament representatives, during which he was informed that the drug has already been detected in Thailand. He also noted that in Dec last year, the Royal Malaysian Customs Department seized 807.9kg of fentanyl worth RM44.4 million at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Air Cargo Complex in Sepang. The drugs, packaged in aluminium bottles, were bound for Dubai. Zaki said police have reason to believe that should drug syndicates make an attempt to smuggle fentanyl into Malaysia, it would be via the Kelantan - Thailand border. ""During my recent meeting with Thai parliament representatives last week, we were told that fentanyl has begun entering Thailand. ""We learnt that the drugs came into Thailand via its border with Myanmar, which is also close to our border. ""Based on this, there is a real possibility of the drugs to entering Malaysia via the Thai - Kelantan border,"" he said at a press conference yesterday. He said state police would be liaising with its Thai counterparts on how to fortify the border. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the area of concern in Kelantan is the Pasir Mas district, in which the town of Rantau Panjang is separated from Thailand via Sungai Golok. Malaysia shared around 96km of Sungai Golok with Thailand. The General Operations Force Southeast Brigade manages a 59km stretch from Pos Ibrahim Pencen to Pulau Tengkorak. It is understood that the presence of more than 160 illegal jetties along Sungai Golok is a major concern for the authorities as these could be used for smuggling activities. The New Straits Times had earlier this month reported how the hot weather and subsequent drying up of Sungai Golok had made it easier for smugglers to cross the river, which can now be done within a minute. Among the items smuggled across include subsidised food items, drugs and even firearms."

Razali was travelling from Taman Cendana to Taman Kota Masai in Johor Baru about 10pm on Feb 11, 2021, when he ran into a pothole and fell on the road. He filed a lawsuit against both the company and the state government for the injuries he suffered in the incident. On May 16, 2022, he withdrew the suit against the state government. The judge said the company had failed to file written or oral arguments despite multiple adjournments.

The court said the company argued that the pothole was not its responsibility, as it was caused by the utility company and should have been repaired by a subcontractor or another party."" Despite this claim, the company failed to initiate any third-party proceedings against any contractor or relevant party in this suit. ""The court also found that it was reasonable that Razali failed to notice the pothole because of limited visibility and insufficient lighting in the residential area.

Two men plead not guilty in Malaysia's first prosecution for rhino horn possession,Luqman Hakim,"April 25, 2024 @ 8:18pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Two men have claimed trial for illegal possession of African rhinoceros horns, marking the country's first prosecution of such a crime. The trial, scheduled to begin in September, follows the seizure of 50 rhino horn pieces nearly three years ago near Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). The media reported that the defendants opted for a trial, reversing their guilty plea recorded during a previous court appearance last month. This unexpected decision caught both media and conservation groups off guard, who had anticipated a sentencing for the accused.    If found guilty, the defendants could face a maximum fine of RM100,000 and up to three years in jail for each charge. Notably, the charges were brought forth before the amendment of the law in 2022, which now imposes heavier penalties for such offences. The two accused were discovered with the items in a Mitsubishi Fuso vehicle, parked by the roadside near Bulatan Masjid KLIA at around 9.15pm on Sep 9, 2021. This seizure marks one of Malaysia's largest rhino horn confiscations and the only instance where a legal case has been initiated. Malaysia, like several other Southeast Asian nations, has been grappling with the trafficking of African rhino horns into Asia.

""I deny allegations of outside parties claiming that the investigation of the LCS case has been stopped when in fact, the investigation is still active and ongoing.

The sentence was handed down by Judge Jason Juga after the accused, Ahmad Rudi Abd Rashid, 50, admitted guilt to the alternative charge read to him and he was found guilty under Section 26 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act (MACC) 2009. According to the alternative charge sheet, the accused had conducted dealings involving a sum of cash amounting to RM8,110, in violation of Section 23 of the MACC Act. The accused received the sum from an individual who is the owner of the Putramas Contractor company, Mohamad Sadeed Mohamad Said. The act took place at the People's Housing Project (PPR) in Bubul Ria, Semporna, at 5.30pm on Feb 26, 2019. For the offence, the accused was charged under Section 26 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, which provides for a fine not exceeding RM50,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years or both. Based on the facts of the case, Ahmad Rudi, as a public officer holding the position of Assistant Economic Affairs Officer Grade E29, who served as chief manager at the Farmers' Organisation Area (PPK) Semporna, was accused of approving Payment Voucher number BB021900065 amounting to RM8,110 to the company owned by Mohamad Sadeed for the payment of Provision of Needs for a visit to meeting involving 30 people from Oct 28 to 31, 2018, despite the fact that the accused himself performed the work. The prosecution was led by MACC Prosecutor Norsham Saharom, while the accused was represented by lawyer Dominic Chew Ban Huat. Earlier, Chew requested a lenient fine based on several arguments presented, including the fact that his client's guilty plea not only saved the Court's time but also showed remorse for his actions besides expressing a desire for repentance. ""He never thought that his actions were an offence under the MACC Act 2009, as he only intended to retrieve his RM8,110 that he had previously advanced to ensure the success of the official visit,"" he said. ""This is our client's first offence, and he has no previous record of wrongdoing. Moreover, he has never faced any disciplinary action throughout his tenure of service, having received the Excellent Service Award from 2004 to 2012 and the Sabah State Medal of Merit (Kinabalu Order Member) in 2016,"" he added. The Court, however, also ordered the accused to serve a five-month jail term if he fails to pay the fine. The accused paid the fine accordingly."

It was following Velarie Lesley Harry's termination for racking up a medical bill of RM25,374 over 17 months four years ago. Sabah Industrial Court chairman Datuk Indra Ayub ordered Malaysian Airports Holdings Bhd (MAHB) to pay damages in back wages and compensation in lieu of reinstatement, FMT reported. The award comprised Velarie's back wages of 24 months amounting to RM64,999 and compensation of one month's salary for each of the seven years of her service totalling RM18,958. ""At the material time, the company did not have any guidelines, rules or policy for unreasonable usage of medical benefits and/or limitations in the number of visits to panel clinics. ""Furthermore, the claimant has been utilising the medical benefits as provided for in the employment offer letter and collective agreements,"" he said in an award dated April 8. The court also agreed with the claimant's contention that the domestic inquiry conducted by MAHB had been done arbitrarily and without regard for the rules of natural justice. Indra noted that MAHB had failed to call any representative from the medical clinics that Velarie had visited to verify whether she had obtained non-medical items as alleged. He said the burden of proof is on the company to prove that the claimant was guilty of committing the alleged misconduct, instead of the claimant must prove that she was not guilty. MAHB claimed that Valerie and several other employees had abused the company's medical benefits. It said it had conducted an analysis of medical claims made by employees in 2019 and found ""rampant medical claim abuses"" by those working at the Kota Kinabalu International Airport (KKIA). It said the claims made by these employees were the highest in the country despite the airport having only 480 employees. ""Claims of 24 employees of the company, including the claimant, for the 17-month period from Jan 1, 2019 were unreasonable in nature. ""Their total claims amounted to RM977,914. ""All of them were dismissed,"" it said. MAHB had contended that Velarie and her dependents had made ""unreasonable visits"" to clinics ""as the dates were very close to one another, were for the same medical reasons and they had obtained the same medication in subsequent visits."" Several employees had obtained non-medical items such as milk powder, diapers, vitamins, 'jamu', wet tissues and toiletries from panel clinics which are not covered under their medical benefits, it said. MAHB also said the claimant had refused to authorise the clinics she attended to hand over details of her visits to enable the company to verify her claims. In response, Velarie said the clinic visits she and her dependents made were justified as they suffered from a variety of illnesses such as fits, gastritis, sore throat, skin problems, ear aches and breathing difficulties. Indra said it was ""obvious that the claimant and her dependents needed constant medical care."" ""This court is satisfied with the claimant's explanation on why she and her dependents needed to visit the clinics often. ""It is of the view that the company had failed to establish on the balance of probabilities that the dismissal was with just cause or excuse,"" he said. Ansari Abdullah and Jason Daniel Balakrishnan Christopher appeared for the claimant, while KH Chung and Kate Ngu Khet Ying defended MAHB."

Najib's bid for 'house arrest' should be made public - CIJ,Iylia Marsya Iskandar,"April 18, 2024 @ 10:53am","KUALA LUMPUR: The Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) has called on the judiciary to keep Datuk Seri Najib Razak's judicial review application to serve his remaining jail sentence under house arrest hearing public. CIJ executive director Wathshlah Naidu said all semblance of inequality and double standards must be removed and the principle of equality before the law must be upheld. She said barring the media and the flow of unbiased information on this case, effectively prevents the public from monitoring the outcome of a corruption case that rocked the nation, making it difficult to hold people accountable and ensure justice prevails. ""CIJ is deeply concerned with the High Court's decision to allow former prime minister Najib's application to be heard in chambers, thus barring the media from covering his judicial review. While we respect the powers of the judiciary and judicial processes, it cannot be seen to undermine democratic principles. ""Najib's bid to seek house arrest for the remainder of his jail sentence is a matter of utmost public interest and the basic tenets of democracy will require the judicial process to be transparent and not be shrouded in a cloud of secrecy. ""The interests of political actors cannot supersede public interest,"" she said in a statement. Watshlah said the judicial system must be underscored by public interest and democratic principles, and there should be no semblance of double standards present within the system. ""Najib, an individual who is from a generational line of political elite, is seen to have disproportionately more access to justice than the general public. ""His recent partial pardon has already set a precedent where the grounds and justification for the decision are yet to be disclosed and made transparent to the public. Access to justice must be implemented fairly using public interest tests and international standards as a baseline. ""It is only by doing this can we begin to eradicate inequality in both the political and judicial system and society as a whole. It is only then that people can once again be confident in the action of our legal and political system,"" she said . She added that barring the media from covering matters that involve political expediency further undermines the trust in the judiciary and ultimately the trust in justice and democracy. ""Political expediency should not play any part in deterring the media as it actively prevents unbiased information from being reported and reduces the credibility of the media as they cannot play an active role in reporting on public interest matters. ""This further sets a precedent that the media cannot cover issues that involve political expediency and creates a system of opacity that leads to a trust deficit"". Yesterday, the public and the media was excluded from hearing Najib's judicial review application. This comes after the former prime minister's defence team applied for the public to be excluded due to ""several sensitive materials"" in the case. Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah made the application at the onset of the proceeding before High Court Judge Datuk Amerjeet Singh yesterday."

""We still lack the capacity to counter these kinds of activities. ""It's not an easy job; it's an uphill battle and we need help not only from our enforcement agencies, but also those in the region and Interpol, among others.

Mohd Mizan also agreed to the idea of installing a fence and closed-circuit television (CCTV) proposed by the police as part of the measures to strengthen border security. ""The CCTV display, for example, should also be made accessible to the nation's top leaders such as the Inspector-General of Police, prime minister and the (relevant) minister. ""Cross-border enforcement should be enhanced from time to time as criminals are always steps ahead.""

"'Boy Tiger' to be jailed, caned after appeal against murdering stepson dismissed",Dawn Chan,"April 17, 2024 @ 3:37pm","PUTRAJAYA: Khairul Izaini Khairuddin, better known as ""Boy Tiger"", was spared the death sentence and will serve 35 years in jail from the date of his arrest and caned 12 times for murdering his stepson, 3, in 2018. The Court of Appeal's three-judge panel, led by Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, had unanimously dismissed Khairul's appeal to set aside the High Court's conviction and sentence against him and for him to be released on grounds of insanity. Vazeer, who sat with Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, said the appeal was meritless and the trial judge did not err in convicting the accused due to overwhelming evidence that the accused had murdered Muhammad Qairil Aqmal Abdul Hakim. Zaidi, who read the broad grounds of judgment, said the conviction was safe and there was no need to disturb the findings that the accused had physically assaulted the deceased because of his temper, and not insanity. He said Khairul's wife was an eyewitness to the attacks on her son, whom she said was repeatedly beaten, stepped on, strangled and thrown against the wall until his head became bloody. He said the wife was unable to stop Khairul, now 37, from his acts as she was heavily pregnant and she too was beaten by him. ""He attacked and physically hurt the deceased as he was angry with him for disturbing his step-sibling, who is his and his wife's biological child. ""The attacks stopped only when the deceased became motionless and there was blood on his head due to the severe blows. ""The accused took the deceased to a private clinic and told the doctor that the boy had been injured in a fall in the toilet. ""The doctor told him to take the deceased to a hospital, where he was certified dead. ""The post-mortem confirmed there were many injuries on the body and head of the deceased. ""There were internal injuries, torn pancreas, and cracked and broken bones on his skull. ""It was confirmed that the injuries on the deceased's head were the cause of his death."" The trial judge, he said, found that the accused had failed to prove his defence of insanity at the time of incident, despite claims that he was a psychiatric patient at Ampang Hospital and Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta and had stopped taking his medications and unaware of the consequences. Zaidi said a medical officer had certified that the accused was aware of his actions on the deceased at the time of the incident, and that evidence failed to be debunked. ""The wife had said the accused stopped beating the deceased when he bled and was motionless and took him to the clinic. ""He told the doctor that the deceased's injuries were due to a fall in the toilet. ""To us, the action and behaviour of the accused clashed with someone who is insane. Instead, it is consistent with someone who is sane. he was insane and was not alert with what he had done, why did he stop assaulting the deceased and took him to the clinic and hospital? ""Someone who is insane would not have done what he did. ""Someone who is insane would not know that a clinic and hospital are places to seek medical treatment. He knew what he had done was against the law. ""He had beaten up the deceased not because he was insane, but because of his hot temper. ""If he was insane, he would not have tried to conceal the truth. Why did he lie and hide the cause of the boy's death?"" On Nov 22,2018, Khairul Izaini, then 31, was charged with the murder of Muhammad Qairil Aqmal, at the living room of a house in Taman Bukit Indah, Ampang. He fled after being informed of the death but was arrested at Kajang Hospital on Nov 12 when he visited his wife, who was being treated after giving birth to a boy."
KWAP's RM1.8 billion sent abroad without due diligence - witness,Bernama,"April 17, 2024 @ 3:33pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court here was today told that SRC International Sdn Bhd failed to perform due diligence on the RM1.8 billion, the first Retirement Fund Incorporated (KWAP) loan, before transferring it offshore for purported investment activities. SRC International's former director Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi, 54, said no due diligence was carried out as the directors' circular resolution (DCR) was signed and approved by Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who was the prime minister and minister of finance at the time. Shahrol Azral said this when testifying as a third party in SRC International's US$1.18 billion civil suit against Najib and its former chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil. ""I felt I was under obligation from the instructions of the PM. I would have preferred for information to be available but I went ahead and signed it. It wasn't only instructions, this was signed by the PM and former finance minister and shareholder of 1MDB so that carried a lot of weight. ""We tried to find as much information as we could but when it came to execution the PM signed off...so we had to do it. The PM thinks its a good idea, I trust his judgments,"" said the witness when queried by Najib's counsel Harvinderjit Singh. The loan money was transferred to Falcon Private Bank Ltd in Switzerland and Julius Baer in Hong Kong, to be used to acquire two companies in Indonesia (PT ABM Investama and Bumi Resources TBk PT) and two companies in Mongolia (Gobi Coal and Energy Limited and Erdens-Tavan Tolgoi). In the SRC criminal trial in 2019, former SRC chairman Tan Sri Ismee Ismail testified that Nik Faisal was ordered by Najib to transfer out the money in a meeting on Sept 7, 2011. SRC, under its new management, filed the suit in May 2021, claiming that Najib had committed a breach of trust and power abuse, personally benefited from the company's funds and misappropriated the said funds. It is also seeking a court declaration that Najib is responsible for the company's losses due to his breach of duties and trust and for Najib to pay back the RM42 million in losses that they have suffered. Najib, 70, has been serving a jail sentence at the Kajang Prison since Aug 23, 2022, after being convicted of misappropriating RM42 million in SRC International funds. He then filed a petition for a royal pardon on Sept 2, 2022, and the Pardons Board in January this year reduced Najib's jail term from 12 years to six, with the fine cut to RM50 million from RM210 million.

The Umno president claimed the impugned document was shown to him by former Selangor Umno treasurer Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz at his house near Country Heights on Jan 30. The Rural and Regional Development minister said this in his supporting affidavit dated April 9 in Najib's judicial review application to compel the government to produce the impugned document. He said Tengku Zafrul showed him a copy of the addendum order on his phone which he personally photographed or scanned from an original copy as shown to him by the former King, Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah. ""The contents of the addendum order expressly stated that the applicant (Najib) be allowed to serve the reduced sentence of his imprisonment under the condition of house arrest, instead of the current prison confinement in the Kajang Prison. ""I further sighted that the addendum order is dated Jan 29 and bears the seal and signature of His Majesty Seri Paduka Baginda the Yang di-Pertuan Agong XVI. ""I further confirm that the addendum order is genuine and in fact is the Royal Prerogative Order as the Main Order. ""I verily believe that for the sufficient period of time I sighted and read the addendum order, and I clearly saw the entire contents and that it forms part of the pardon process. ""Thus, I hereby confirm the existence of the addendum order dated Jan 29 issued by the former King,"" he claimed in the document which is accessible to the public domain on the judiciary website. According to the affidavit, Zahid said he did not have a copy of the impugned document but that others including the Attorney-General and Pahang Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Wan Rosdy Wan Ismail had sighted the addendum order. Earlier, Najib's counsel, Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah asked the court to exclude the public from hearing the application due to ""several sensitive materials"" in the case. Senior Federal Counsels Shamsul Bolhassan and Ahmad Hanir Hambaly did not object to his request for the matters to be heard in chambers. Judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh allowed Shafee's application and fixed June 5 to deliver the verdict. Outside of court, Shafee told reporters that he could not name the person attesting the affidavit. He also claimed the affidavit had been sealed by the court and could not be accessed by anyone else. However, when contacted, a deputy court registrar told the New Straits Times that the court did not issue any seal order on the affidavit. On Jan 29, Najib, the former Pekan member of parliament filed an application to compel the government to produce the impugned document which he said was not revealed by the authorities. He named the Home Minister, Prison Department commissioner general, Attorney-General (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents. Najib said he later instructed his solicitors to confirm the details of the addendum order with the AG by way of a letter dated Feb 14. The letter was copied to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as well as his deputy Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. The existence of the addendum order and its non-enforcement was escalated to the Home Minister on March 22. Najib has claimed that his lawyers have requested an original copy or a copy of the order from the Kajang Prison but has not received a response. He also claimed the subsequent inaction by the Home Minister and Prison Department commissioner general to execute the said order, is irrational, unreasonable, illegal, and arbitrary and offends the Federal Constitution and laws. Najib is currently serving a 12-year jail term after he was found guilty of abuse of power and criminal breach of trust involving RM42 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB subsidiary. He was also fined RM210 million."
May hearing for prosecution's appeal against sentences of 18 ex-students linked to cadet's death,Dawn Chan,"April 17, 2024 @ 1:29pm","PUTRAJAYA: The Court of Appeal (CoA) will next month hear the prosecution's appeal against the Kuala Lumpur High Court's ruling that convicted six former National Defence University (UPNM) students to 18 years' jail. They were found guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder of navy cadet Zulfarhan Osman Zulkarnain seven years ago. Counsel Datuk Hisham Teh Poh Teik, representing Muhammad Najib Mohd Razi as respondent, said the CoA set a three-day hearing from May 14. Hisham was met after the proceedings presided by a three-judge panel led by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail. Also on the panel were Justices Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. ""The CoA, on the same day, will hear the prosecution's appeal against the High Court's decision that also meted out three years' jail on five of the six accused, as well as 12 other former students for causing injuries on Zulfarhan,"" said Hisham. All 18 of them, now aged 28, were present in the CoA today. The court's public gallery was filled with their family members. The High Court, in its 2021 decision, granted a stay of execution against 12 of the accused. During proceedings, Justice Hadhariah allowed the prosecution, as appellant, for extension of time to file the petition of appeal after deputy public prosector Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar said there were no objections from the respondents on the application. On Nov 2, 2021, High Court judge Datuk Azman Abdullah sentenced the six — Muhammad Akmal Zuhairi Azmal, Azamuddin Mad Sofi, Muhammad Najib, Muhammad Afif Najmudin Azahat, Mohamad Shobirin Sabri and Abdoul Hakeem Mohd Ali, who was initially charged with abetment — to 18 years in jail under Section 304 of the Penal Code from their date of arrest on June 1, 2017. The judge sentenced them under a lesser charge after finding that the common intention and abetment of the sixth accused had caused injuries to Zulfarhan but there was no intention of murder. Judge Azman also sentenced the six, except for Mohamad Shobirin, along with 12 others, to three years' jail after finding them guilty of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Zulfarhan to coerce a confession from him that he had stolen a laptop. The others guilty of causing grievous hurt to Zulfarhan were ordered to serve their jail term from the day of sentencing. The 12 former students are Mohd Hafiz Fauzan Ismail, Mohamad Lukhmanul Hakim Mohd Zain, Ahmad Shafwan Berdal, Muhammad Amirul Asraff Mala, Luqman Hakim Shamsuri Agus, Muhammad Sufi Mohd Mustapha, Noriznan Izzairi Noor Azhar, Muhamad Ashraf Abdullah, Muhammad Danial Firdaus Azmir, Muhammad Hasif Ismail, Muhammad Adib Iman Fuad Ady Sani and Mohamad Syazwan Musa.

Public barred from proceedings in Najib's challenge on 'house arrest',Rahmat Khairulrijal,"April 17, 2024 @ 11:34am","KUALA LUMPUR: The public has been excluded from hearing Datuk Seri Najib Razak's judicial review application to serve his remaining jail sentence under house arrest. This comes after the former prime minister's defence team applied for the public to be excluded due to ""several sensitive materials"" in the case. Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah made the application at the onset of the proceeding before High Court Judge Datuk Amerjeet Singh this morning. The ""sensitive materials"" are related to Najib's claim that the former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah allowed him to serve his remaining jail sentence under house arrest via an addendum order. Shafee said Senior Federal Counsels Shamsul Bolhassan and Ahmad Hanir Hambaly did not object to his request for the matters to be heard in chambers. The court allowed the matter to be held in chambers after Shafee informed the court that a ""crucial witness"" filed a supporting affidavit to bolster Najib's application. At press time, both parties are submitting a gag order application by Shafee to prevent the media from publishing the supporting affidavit from the ""crucial witness"". The former Pekan member of parliament filed the application to compel the government to produce the impugned document, the contents of which Najib says have not been revealed by the government. He named the Home Minister, Prison Department commissioner general, Attorney-General (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents. Najib in his Jan 29 affidavit, said former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ordered for his jail term to be reduced to six years and his fine for the SRC International case to be reduced to RM50 million (main order). ""The King also immediately or simultaneously issued an addendum order on the same day stipulating that Najib be allowed to serve the reduced sentence of his imprisonment under home arrest instead of confinement in Kajang Prison. ""The addendum order curiously was not announced by any of the respondents when the announcement of the main order was made. ""It must be impressed that the addendum order was already in existence since Jan 29, but this anomaly was never revealed nor explained by any of the respondents,"" he claimed. Najib said he later instructed his solicitors to confirm the details of the addendum order with the AG by way of a letter dated Feb 14. The letter was copied to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as well as his deputy Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. The existence of the addendum order and its non-enforcement was escalated to the Home Minister on March 22. Najib has claimed that his lawyers have requested an original copy or a copy of the order from the Kajang Prison but has not received a response. He also claimed the subsequent inaction by the Home Minister and Prison Department commissioner general to execute the said order, is irrational, unreasonable, illegal, and arbitrary and offends the Federal Constitution and laws. Najib is currently serving a 12-year jail term after he was found guilty of abuse of power and criminal breach of trust involving RM42 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB subsidiary. He was also fined RM210 million."
Illegal firearms a mere click away [NSTTV],Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"April 17, 2024 @ 7:05am","KOTA BARU: For Malaysian criminals, buying firearms from the black market in Thailand has never been easier. Previously, they would rely on an extensive network of contacts to secure guns in the neighbouring country and smuggle them over the border themselves. That exposes them to the risk of being caught when traversing one of the many illegal crossings along Sungai Golok to Pasir Mas in Kelantan. Now, with Internet technology, criminals need only browse a website to choose their weapons. The hot and dry spell, which has dried up parts of Sungai Golok, has enabled them to easily walk across the border within a minute without being detected by patrols. Thai police said the illegal firearms were purchased via Thai-run sites in the darkweb. Sungai Golok police chief Colonel Jadsadavit Inprapan said Malaysian criminals would either order these weapons themselves or get their Thai contacts to purchase the guns on their behalf. ""These guns, usually from Bangkok, would be brought to Thai border towns for buyers to pick up,"" he said, adding that Sungai Golok town on the Thai side was fast becoming a ""meeting point"" for these transactions. Jadsadavit said based on their checks, the most popular pistols sought by Malaysians include revolvers, as well as Glock and Sig Sauer handguns. He said such guns were also cheaper in the Thai black market, costing between RM2,000 and RM8,000 each. However, their prices, he said, would usually double when resold in Malaysia. He said Sungai Golok police had been seizing an average of one illegal firearm a week in the border town. The latest incident involved two Malaysians from Kelantan and Kuala Lumpur, who were arrested in a pub last month. Two illegal guns were found in their possession. Gun-related crimes recently came under the spotlight in Malaysia. Last month, a man suspected of being an Israeli agent was arrested at a hotel in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur where he was found with six handguns. The pistols included a Glock 19 Marine, Glock 17 Gen 4, Smith and Wesson, Sig Sauer and Stoeger, along with 200 rounds of ammunition. He had illegally bought the firearms from a local couple, who in turn, obtained them from Thailand. On Monday, police arrested a man who tried to shoot his wife at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on the day before. He missed his target and hit his wife's bodyguard instead. Police believed he also obtained his gun from a neighbouring country.   Kelantan police chief Datuk Muhamad Zaki Harun said they were aware of the existence of encrypted websites that illegally sold firearms. ""We have received information from our Thai counterparts, who have been sharing intelligence on the issue,"" he said, adding that state police were beefing up measures to tackle the problem. Zaki said there had been an increase in the number of firearm seizures in the state. He said in 2022, state police had seized nine illegal guns. That number, he said, rose to 19 last year. ""In the first three months of this year, we have seized eight illegal firearms,"" he said, adding that the majority of the seizures took place in the Pasir Mas district, Kota Baru and Machang. He said police believed that most buyers were drug dealers who wanted guns for protection. Semi-automatic guns, he said, appeared to be the favourite due to their easy handling. He did not dismiss the possibility that the falling water level in Sungai Golok had made smuggling guns across the border much easier. ""We realise that smugglers will capitalise on the river drying up to step up their activities, which include trafficking drugs and firearms. ""They might also seize the chance to set up new routes or more illegal jetties. ""We have instructed the General Operations Force to beef up their operations against such activities,"" he said.  "
Dry Sungai Golok riverbed facilitates smuggling,Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"April 17, 2024 @ 7:02am","KOTA BARU: The drying up of Sungai Golok has made it easier for smugglers to cross the Malaysia-Thailand border undetected. Sources familiar with those involved in smuggling claimed that at certain stretches of the river, smugglers could dash across the dry riverbed in less than a minute. A Thai national, who only wanted to be known as Jai, said in certain areas like Jeram Perdah near here, the distance between the Malaysian and Thai riverbank was less than 50 metres. This, said the 28-year-old from Tak Bai, meant that smugglers could easily ferry their contraband across, which include foodstuff, drugs and even guns. ""This has prompted many smugglers to exploit the situation to smuggle more contraband items across. The smugglers will usually communicate with each other via mobile phone and set a meeting point after ensuring that there are no security patrols.   ""In the past, you needed a boat, which would take five minutes to cross the river. But now, at certain parts of the river, you can just wade across with little effort,"" he said. Smugglers, he added, could also choose from the almost 160 illegal jetties along Sungai Golok to cut across to the other side. ""They won't use the same jetty all the time. If one jetty is getting attention from the authorities, they will simply shift to a more secluded one,"" he said. A Pasir Mas resident who declined to be named claimed that an average of one firearm makes its way across the border every month. ""Some are seized by the authorities, but there are still guns which will be smuggled into Malaysia. ""For these smugglers, it's risky business but there is a lucrative payoff,"" claimed the 43-year-old, who said smugglers could make about RM2,000 per smuggled gun. A commander of the General Operations Force (GOF) tasked with maintaining security along the border concurred that the falling water level in Sungai Golok has added another challenge to the authorities.   GOF Southeast Brigade commander Senior Assistant Commissioner Sheik Azhar Sheik Omar said its three battalions had foiled 1,262 smuggling attempts last year, and recorded seizures totalling RM118.6 million. ""The seized goods included rice, frozen chicken and livestock. There were also cases where we seized drugs and firearms,"" he said, adding that the majority of the cases were in Rantau Panjang and Pasir Mas. Azhar also underscored the challenge of patrolling the porous Malaysia-Thai border. He said Malaysia shared around 96km of Sungai Golok with Thailand. The GOF Southeast Brigade, he said, manages a 59km stretch from Pos Ibrahim Pencen to Pulau Tengkorak. Azhar said while the current manpower of 400 personnel was adequate, he believed that setting up a perimeter fencing along the border would go a long way to deter smuggling. ""The establishment of a buffer zone can also help tackle smuggling,"" he said."
"Former AirAsia X technicians awarded RM110,000 in retrenchment benefits",New Straits Times,"April 16, 2024 @ 10:49pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Labour Court has ordered a commercial airline company to disburse approximately RM110,000 in retrenchment benefits to two former aircraft technicians who were laid off amid the Covid-19 pandemic. FMT reported that according to an order issued on April 2, Manpower Department director-general Nor Fathiyah Mohd Yassin said AiraAsia X Bhd is obligated to compensate Hasrulnizam Nopen with RM51,391.44 and Ahmad Abu Bakar with RM57,808.90 as part of their termination benefits. The ruling stipulates that the defendant will be subject to an 8 per cent per annum interest charge if the payment is not made within 31 days of the order. Hasrulnizam's employment was terminated on June 7, 2020, while Ahmad's was terminated on Jan 20, 2021, due to the grounding of planes amid the pandemic. Their employer refused to pay retrenchment benefits because their monthly basic salaries and allowances were more than RM5,000. The employer took the position that one is only entitled to compensation under the Employment (Termination and Lay-Off Benefit) Regulations 1980 if their monthly wage is RM2,000 and below. Hasrulnizam and Ahmad lodged their complaints with the department in 2022. Representing the technicians, lawyer Premjit Singh asserted that their roles as aircraft technicians inherently qualified them for retrenchment benefits as per the Employment Act and its regulations, despite their earnings exceeding RM2,000. ""They were engaged in the operation or maintenance of mechanically propelled vehicles for the transport of goods or passengers,"" he said. The company has filed an appeal at the High Court against the Labour Court's decision. Lawyers Wendy Lam and Wong Jia Ee appeared for AirAsia X."

He said the raid was conducted based on information obtained from surveillance operations by the Kuala Muda police headquarters' Special Branch from 10.50am to 1.40pm. ""Upon arrival, the operation team found two men being involved in transferring diesel from the said trailer to two trucks. ""As a result, the police detained both suspects. During inspection they discovered liquid suspected to be diesel, estimated to be 800 litres in volume, inside one of the trucks, and liquid suspected to be diesel with an estimated volume of 2,100 litres inside the other truck. ""Further checks inside the trailer revealed liquid suspected to be diesel, estimated at 27,000 litres,"" he said at a press conference at the Kuala Muda police headquarters today. Anuar said the trailer and two trucks containing subsidised diesel totalling 29,900 litres were seized. ""The estimated value of the seized diesel is approximately RM44,991.84. ""All the seized items were confiscated, and the total estimated value of the seizure is RM149,991.84,"" he said. Anuar said the trailer driver was suspected of transporting the subsidised diesel from an oil depot in Prai in Penang to be used by fishermen in the Kuala Kedah area. However, he said, during the journey, the driver was believed to have made a stop in Bedong to sell subsidised diesel for RM250 per 200 litres. ""The owner of the premises in his 40s admitted to buying the subsidised diesel from the trailer driver. ""The case is being investigated by the Commercial Crime Investigation Department under Section 407 of the Penal Code.""

Couple pleaded guilty to causing injury to two children,Ersie Anjumin,"April 16, 2024 @ 9:10pm","KENINGAU: A couple involved in a recent abuse case in Sabah was charged in the magistrate's court here for causing hurt to two boys under their care. The man aged 27 and the woman aged 36 pleaded guilty to their respective charges before Magistrate Flavian Edward Henry. The man faced two charges for causing hurt to the two boys – aged 13 and an undocumented five-year-old, between March 24 and 30, at a rented room in Pekan Keningau. The offences under Section 323 carry a jail term of up to one year or a fine of up to RM2,000, or both, upon conviction. The woman faced three charges against her. The first charge stated that she allegedly had caused hurt to the young undocumented boy at the same time and place. For the other two charges, she was accused of causing injury to the two boys using an iron also at the same time and place. For causing injury using a weapon, the punishment provides a jail term of up to 10 years or with a fine or with whipping or any two of such punishments, upon conviction under Section 324 of the Penal Code. The court fixed May 17 for the next mention, pending the full medical report on the two victims. The man was offered RM2,500 bail for each charge while the woman's bail was set at RM6,000 per charge for the Section 324 charges and RM4,000 for the other charge. Both of the accused, who were unrepresented, were unable to post bail. It was also learnt that the couple was not married. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ramona Albert prosecuted the cases. It was reported that the couple was arrested following a police report lodged by a man who encountered the 13-year-old boy selling burgers on April 2. The man observed injuries on the child's body, resembling those inflicted by an iron. Further investigation found that another five-year-old boy had also been abused. Neither victim has any biological relation to the couple; the older boy is the stepson of the woman, while the younger child is adopted."

Court upholds ex-transporter's 20-year jail for sexual assault of underage sisters,Bernama,"April 16, 2024 @ 7:22pm","PUTRAJAYA: The Court of Appeal here today maintained the 20-year jail term imposed on a former transporter for committing 10 counts of physical sexual assault against two underage sisters. A three-member panel of judges comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin dismissed his appeal for a lower jail sentence. Justice Hadhariah, in delivering the court's decision, said the man's appeal did not have any merit. Earlier, in the proceedings, Justice Hadhariah said sexual offences against children were rampant. The court also upheld the 27 strokes of caning meted out by the High Court on the 43-year-old. Justice Hadhariah said the court declined to reduce the number of strokes imposed on the man although the law states that a convict may be whipped a maximum of 24 times. She added that the court would leave it to prison authorities. The man committed the offences on the girls, then aged 14 and 11, at a convenience store and car park of a religious school in Kampar, Perak between June 16 and 17, 2020. He pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexually assaulting the older sister and the Sessions Court sentenced him to 10 years each, with the sentences to run concurrently. He was also ordered to be given 18 strokes of caning. The man was also sentenced to 10 years in jail for three counts of committing sexual assault on the younger sister. He was ordered to be given another nine strokes of the cane, with the sentences to run concurrently. The Sessions Court ordered for the 10-year jail term to commence after the man had completed serving the 10-year jail for the offences against the older sister. He was ordered to serve the sentence from the date of his arrest on June 20, 2020. On July 21 last year, the High Court reduced the jail sentence of one of the charges from 10 years and three strokes of the cane to three years and no caning. The High Court judge, however, stated that it would not make any difference as the jail sentences were to run concurrently. Lawyer Mohamad Zaidan Daud represented the man while deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution.— BERNAMA"

Sequerah in his ruling said there had been no communication between them since Loo left the firm 15 years ago.  He said there was no nexus between the issues in this trial and the past relationship between him and his former partner in legal practice. ""There was no inkling nor was there an iota of evidence to even form any basis upon which any form of relationship could possibly be conjured.

"Charities Commission needed to screen NGOs and curb money laundering crimes, says expert",Nuradzimmah Daim,"April 16, 2024 @ 3:00pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The government should consider establishing independent oversight bodies, such as a Charities Commission, to regulate non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This will prevent them from being used for money laundering by crime syndicates, said an expert. Centre to Combat Corruption and Cronyism chief executive officer Pushpan Murugiah said in order to close the gap in the law, it was urgent that the authorities look into revising how charitable activities are governed. He said this could be done either through revisions of individual laws such as the Societies Act 1966 and the Companies Act 2016. ""The issue in Malaysia is that NGOs come in many forms, including as companies under the Companies Commission Malaysia and societies under the purview of the Registrar of Societies.  ""Depending on how they are registered, a fraudulent NGO may be able to utilise different legal loopholes for illicit activities,"" he told the New Straits Times. He said the public should ensure that they keep up to date with recommendations by the authorities, such as Bank Negara Malaysia, on how to avoid scams involving mule accounts or phishing. That way, prospective donors can be more confident in knowing that the money they donate is actually being used for their intended purpose, he said. ""However, as was seen with the Aman Palestinian scandal, it may be difficult for individuals to figure out exactly where their donations are being channelled or if that money is being used for improper purposes. ""Therefore, before donating, it is key to conduct some basic background research into the particular organisation's activities by reading their published annual reports and financial statements,"" he said. Another expert said the public should practise caution before donating, lest they unknowingly become enablers for crime syndicates who use charity funds for money laundering. CSO Platform for Reform chair Jerald Joseph said it was time for the public to get to know the NGOs and their main leadership more closely to see if their track records support universal human rights and comply with good governance. ""I think we need to help people understand that there are hundreds of thousands of NGOs in Malaysia and, of course, some have abused this entity for very corrupt ends. ""Just a general statement does a disservice to the majority of NGOs that are doing good work,"" he said. He suggested that the authorities name the suspicious groups so that those involved could be isolated while calling out against bad practices in aiding and abetting criminals. Jerald said a few NGOs involved in illegal activities such as money laundering could undermine the good work done by many others. Police Anti-Money Laundering Criminal Investigation Division head Datuk Mohammed Hasbullah Ali was reported as saying charitable donations to NGOs were among the ways criminal syndicates were laundering proceeds from their illicit activities including illegal gambling, drugs, smuggling and extortion. The money would then be channelled back to the syndicates and the NGOs would receive a commission in return for their assistance. Money laundering activities cause hundreds of millions of ringgit in losses for Malaysia."

District police chief Superintendent Hoo Chang Hook said the chase began when the lorry driver made an illegal U-turn at Km9 Jalan Bahau-Kemayan after realising that there was a police roadblock ahead. He said, in the course of making the illegal turn, the lorry rammed into a motorcycle ridden by a 40-year-old man. ""Police gave chase as soon as this happened.

""Several times, the driver nearly knocked into the traffic policemen giving chase on their motorcycles, as well as other road users,"" he said in a statement.

That did not last long, however, and police managed to arrest the 21-year-old man near an oil palm estate.

When I got to the location (of the crash), his body had already been covered with a white cloth... how was to keep from crying out? ""When I first heard Amin had gotten into an accident, I prayed that Allah would not take his life.

M'sian waitress who performed illegal dental procedures fined by Singapore court,New Straits Times,"April 8, 2024 @ 11:29pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A part-time waitress employed at a hotel in Johor was fined S$2,500 (approximately RM8,760) by a district court in Singapore for carrying out dental procedures without a valid licence.

According to Channel News Asia (CNA), the woman learned how to perform dental procedures on herself during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is learned that this arose from her inability to attend dental appointments due to Malaysia's movement control orders aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19.

Despite not being registered as a dentist under Singapore's Dental Registration Act and lacking a valid practice certificate, she proceeded with these procedures. The woman fully paid the fine imposed, as the Singaporean health ministry prosecutor sought a fine, considering the potential risks of her unauthorised procedures causing serious harm."

Former 1MDB general counsel Jasmine Loo Ai Swan said the decision was made by the company's top brass after discussions with global investment banking and securities firm Goldman Sachs. ""1MDB's board made the final decision after it was briefed by the management. ""Najib, who was then the prime minister, finance minister, as well as the chairman of 1MDB's advisory board, did not give any instructions on the acquisition of Tanjong,"" she said under cross-examination by Najib's lead counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah.

(Updated) Najib files legal bid asking for house arrest,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"April 3, 2024 @ 2:55pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Datuk Seri Najib Razak claimed that former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, had granted him permission to serve his remaining jail sentence under house arrest. The former prime minister claimed it was part of the then King's addendum order but has been kept silent by the government since January this year. Hence, Najib via his counsel from Messrs. Shafee & Co. has filed a judicial review at the High Court recently to compel the government to produce the impugned addendum dated Jan 29. He named the Home Minister, Prison Department commissioner general, Attorney-General (AG), Federal Territories Pardons Board, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform), Legal Affairs Division director-general, and the government as respondents. Najib in his affidavit claimed on Jan 29 that the then King ordered that the applicant's (Najib) imprisonment be reduced to six years and the fine reduced to RM50 million (main order). ""The King also immediately or simultaneously issued an addendum order on the same day stipulating that Najib be allowed to serve the reduced sentence of his imprisonment under condition of home arrest instead of confinement in Kajang Prison. ""The addendum order curiously was not announced by any of the respondents when the announcement of the main order only was made. ""It must be impressed that the addendum order was already in existence since Jan 29, but this anomaly was never revealed nor explained by any of the respondents,"" he claimed. Najib claimed he later instructed his solicitors to confirm the details of the addendum order with the AG by way of a letter dated Feb 14 and copied to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim as well as his deputy Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. ""Subsequently, on March 22, the matter was escalated to the home minister regarding inter alia, the existence and lack of enforcement of the addendum order. ""On Feb 19, the applicant's solicitors also requested the original copy or a copy thereof of the main order from the Kajang Prison, but that request went unanswered. ""Consequently, since Jan 29, the applicant's personal rights have been adversely affected and infringed upon by the decision of all the respondents in ignoring and refraining from responding to the inquiries,"" he claimed. Najib claimed the subsequent inaction by the Home Minister and Prison Department commissioner general to execute the said order, is irrational, unreasonable, illegal and arbitrary and offends the Federal Constitution and laws. ""His Majesty's orders are not merely administrative decrees, but reflections of the legal and moral authority vested in the Monarchy. ""Therefore, the respondents' disregard to the requests of the applicant constitutes a direct intrusion of the applicant's basic right as provided in the Federal Constitution and the laws generally. ""Over and above this the defiance of the Respondents constitute a direct contempt of the Institution of His Majesty Seri Paduka Baginda The Yang Di-Pertuan Agong. ""The respondents instead of obeying the orders of His Majesty, has unreasonably and irrationally denied the same in totality without lawful cause nor provide any cogent excuse/reasons for the failure,"" he claimed. Najib asserted that the act of the respondents in not responding to his queries necessarily draws the adverse inference against them, in that the addendum order does exist with the substantive content as contended by the applicant. Najib is currently serving a 12-year jail term after he was found guilty of one count of abuse of power with regard to Retirement Fund Inc's (KWAP) RM4 billion loan to SRC International Sdn Bhd, as well as three counts each of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power involving RM42 million of SRC funds. He was also fined RM210 million. SRC is a former subsidiary of 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). In August 2022, the Federal Court upheld the conviction."

"Ex-security guard files appeal to reinstate RM66,000 award for wrongful dismissal by US Embassy",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"April 3, 2024 @ 12:34pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former security guard L. Subramaniam has filed an appeal to reinstate the RM66,000 award given by the Industrial Court for his wrongful dismissal by the United States Embassy last year. According to Subramaniam's appeal notice, his counsel R. Kesavan filed the notice in the High Court Registry on April 2, a day after the High Court judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh annuls the reward. Amarjeet in his judgment said the applicant (the US government) and its embassy had immunity and were protected from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court over the claim by former security guard L. Subramaniam under Section 20 (3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967. The US government filed a judicial review application (against the Industrial Court's decision) on Aug 9, last year, naming the Industrial Court and Subramaniam as the first and second respondents. It sought an order for the High Court to annul the award given by the Industrial Court in 2023 to Subramaniam. The US government also sought a court order that Subramaniam's dismissal for internal disciplinary misconduct was within the embassy, saying that the country and its embassy are protected by immunity from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court concerning claims under Section 20(3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967. On Jan 8, 2020, the High Court ruled that the US government and its embassy were protected by immunity and prohibited the Industrial Court from adjudicating Subramaniam's unlawful dismissal claim case. However, in 2021, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's decision and ordered the Industrial Court to proceed with hearing the dispute, prompting the US government to bring the matter up to the Federal Court, but the appeal was rejected. On April 27 last year, the Industrial Court ordered the US Embassy to pay RM66,000 to Subramaniam after finding that he was unlawfully dismissed. Subramaniam had been a security guard at the embassy for more than 10 years before he was terminated in 2008.

Siti stepped in upon realising that government contract worker Fatimah was being scammed and helped her file a case report with the bank, swiftly freezing her account to safeguard her hard-earned money. This was despite relentless attempts by the scammer to disrupt the proceedings with incessant calls. In a statement, Maybank said Fatimah received a phone call purportedly from the bank, alleging her involvement in an unauthorised transactions and illicit mule account activities. ""The caller orchestrated a series of manipulative phone calls to individuals posing as representatives from various enforcement and regulatory agencies, including the Royal Malaysia Police and Bank Negara Malaysia,"" the bank said in a statement. The call lasted for more than four hours and Fatimah was told to withdraw RM150,000 from her saving accounts at the Kampung Baru branch. Fatimah said  the teller at the branch asked her the purpose of withdrawal but the scammer had instructed her to lie and state that the monies were for house renovation purposes. The branch's assistant manager only known as Siti took action upon realising that Fatimah may be a victim of a scam. Maybank protected customers from losing RM6.4 million to financial scams via branch channels in 2023.

[UPDATED] Tan pleads not guilty to cheating in Spanco case [NSTTV],Dawn Chan,"April 3, 2024 @ 10:01am","KUALA LUMPUR: Tycoon Tan Sri Tan Hua Choon pleaded not guilty to a charge of cheating related to a government fleet vehicle contract worth RM3.9 billion five years ago. The 83-year-old Spanco Sdn Bhd chairman, widely known as Robert Tan in the corporate world, was charged under Section 420 of the Penal Code before Sessions Court judge Suzana Hussin. Asked by the court interpreter if he understood the charge which was read out in Bahasa Melayu, and his plea, Tan said, ""I understand. I am not guilty. I have done so much for the country."" The charge sheet read that Tan was accused of cheating the Finance Ministry's tender committee to award Spanco Sdn Bhd a contract valued RM3,966,386,628 through the Public Private Partnership Unit for a tender titled ""Request For Proposal For Supply, Repair, Maintenance and Management of Government of Malaysia Vehicle Fleet."" He had allegedly cheated the ministry that there was at least 30 per cent of Bumiputera share ownership in Spanco through a document titled ""Appendix IV(Annex i) Bidder's Profile and therefore, dishonestly induced the ministry to award the contract, which it would not have done so if it were to be deceived that way. Tan, who is the company's executive director, allegedly committed the offence at the ministry's tender room office in Putrajaya between Feb 27 and Feb 28, 2019. The charge carries jail imprisonment not less than one year and not more than 10 years; with whipping and fine, if guilty. Deputy public prosecutor Mahadi Abdul Jumaat proposed a bail of RM2 million with one surety, taking into consideration the value stated in the charge, the severity of the case and Tan's status. ""This amount has been agreed between the prosecution and defence. ""As additional conditions, the accused must surrender his international passport, or diplomatic passport, if he has, and report to the nearest Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Kuala Lumpur office in the first week of the month until the disposal of the case. ""We also ask for the accused not to harass or contact any prosecution witness directly or through third parties until the disposal of the case,"" he said. In mitigation, Tan's counsel Datuk Wan Azmir Wan Majid said his client suffered from hypertension as well as knee and back pain which required him to move around aided with a walking stick and assisted by his staff. ""In this case, the bailor is his own son and the proposed bail amount of RM2 million is a high sum. However, my client did not object to it. ""The requests for my client to surrender his passport bars his travel movement, and to report to the MACC once a month are not necessary, because of his condition. ""Alternatively, I ask the court to consider easing my client's movement because of his health condition and to report to the MACC once every three months. He is not a flight risk,"" he said. Counsel Razlan Hadri, who held a watching brief for Spanco, told the court that the accused, as the company's executive director, was still active in the daily business affairs. He asked for the definition of harassing prosecution witnesses and asked for a list of them as he feared Tan would unknowingly come in contact with any of them. In reply, Mahadi said as the case was high profile and Tan had been charged, public interest was priority. He said the additional conditions were necessary to ensure Tan's attendance in court and asked bail to be fixed. ""On the issue of harassing or contacting prosecution witnesses, we know that the accused is still working in the company and this, for sure, cannot be avoided. ""It is when we get reports of any attempts to discuss with prosecution witnesses or any efforts to influence them when giving a statement. ""It is not about them coming in contact or the witness has to resign from the company. That is not our intention,"" he said. Judge Suzana set RM2 million bail with one surety."
Tan Sri Robert Tan arrives in court to face charges,Dawn Chan,"April 3, 2024 @ 8:50am","KUALA LUMPUR: Tan Sri Robert Tan Hua Choon has arrived at the court complex here and is expected to face charges related to a government fleet vehicle contract. The tycoon walked into the building at about 8.13am accompanied by several individuals. Checks with the judiciary system showed that the businessman will be brought before Judge Suzana Husin at 9am. A source close to the investigation said he will face charges under Section 420 of the Penal Code. The offence carries a jail term of between one and 10 years for whipping, as well as a fine, upon conviction. In January, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission raided Tan's residence for an investigation into allegations of corruption involving the procurement and management of the government's fleet of vehicles worth RM4.5 billion. The graftbusters also raided four companies, including a government vehicle supplier. Over 100 private accounts and companies under the companies' control were also reportedly obtained by the MACC for further investigation. However, no account freezes were imposed. The concession to supply and manage government vehicles has been held by Spanco Sdn Bhd since 1993. However, after the contract ended in 2019, an open tender was launched. Berjaya Group and Naza Sdn Bhd later formed a consortium and secured the contract through a Letter of Intent (LOI) in that year. Last July, Berjaya's founder, Tan Sri Vincent Tan, filed a lawsuit against the Finance Ministry and Spanco regarding the terminated LOI, alleging that the contract was awarded to Spanco despite their higher bid. Tan's claims prompted calls for an MACC investigation, but there were no developments until the recent raid."

"Witness says never met Najib, although millions had been paid to middleman Gnanaraja for the former PM",Dawn Chan,"April 2, 2024 @ 9:17pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A star prosecution witness told the Sessions Court today that he had never met Datuk Seri Najib Razak, although he paid RM19 million to businessman G.Gnanaraja to be given to the former prime minister. Former Consortium Zenith Construction Sdn Bhd (CZCSB) director Datuk Zarul Ahmad Mohd Zulkifli said this when questioned by defence counsel R.S.N Rayer on his statement given to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). Zarul was testifying before judge Azura Alwi, in a proceedings to challenge his credibility over his contradictory statements in court on former Penang chief minister Lim Guan Eng's on-going RM6.34 billion undersea tunnel project trial. During proceedings, Rayer read out Zarul's statement in which he said that the payment to Gnanaraja totalling RM19 million was all meant for the prime minister (PM). Rayer: PM means Datuk Seri Najib Razak, right? Zarul: Yes Rayer: It was not meant for Lim Guan Eng? You did not mention here. Zarul: No, I did not mention Rayer: Because it was meant for Najib, given to Gnanaraja Zarul: Yes Rayer: And in the last part you said this. Although I gave the money to Gnanaraja, I have never met with PM until now. You never met Najib Razak? Zarul: No. Zarul agreed with Rayer, who had read out his statement which cited that the sum paid to Gnanaraja was from a RM2.3 million loan obtained from Vizione Construction Sdn Bhd managing director Datuk Ng Aun Hooi where RM2 million was given to Gnanaraja for Najib while he had used the balance of RM300,000 for his business. He also agreed that while being investigated by the MACC, he was shown bank statements that on Aug 17,2017, there was a RM2.3 million loan transaction he had taken from Ng and the next day, a cheque withdrawal transaction worth RM2 million was executed and it was meant for Gnanaraja. He replied in the affirmative when asked by Rayer if there was no mention of Lim. Zarul also said he had paid Gnanaraja RM17 million to close a case he was linked to with the MACC. Zarul agreed to a question by co-defence counsel Tiara Katrina Fuad that the RM2 million loan from Ng was meant for Gnanaraja and not Lim. He also agreed that in a meeting with Ng on the loan, he did not mention Lim and said that it was for Gnanaraja. Tiara: In a previous statement in Shah Alam (court), you focused solely on the case on Gnanaraja. The statement you made is Gnanaraja cheated you about the PM. So the money given to Gnanaraja for the purpose of PM is the subject of your Shah Alam statement. You were not talking about Lim. Zarul: Yes The trial continues on April 4. In January this year, Guan Eng, who is the former Penang chief minister, obtained a witness statement to challenge the credibility of Zarul, whose company, CZCSB, was the company awarded the project. The defence had all this while contended that Zarul had made contradicting statements when testifying as a key witness in Guan Eng's trial. He is facing four charges of using his position as the then chief minister to solicit gratification to help Zarul's company secure the undersea tunnel project. He was alleged to have sought a 10 per cent take of the profit to be made by the company from Zarul and accused of receiving RM3.3 million for himself and causing two plots of land belonging to the state government to be disposed of two companies linked to the project."

Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain said investigations had not yielded any positive leads regarding the man allegedly hunted by the suspect. ""Based on the suspect's confession, he was looking for an Israeli man named Eran over a family feud, but we need to confirm that this man exists. ""For now, we have yet to find him (Eran).""

""We're examining how a foreigner coming to Malaysia could obtain six firearms within a few days of being here, so we're looking at all angles. ""He could be a coordinator or perhaps an armourer or just came to acquire weapons. ""So those are all angles of our investigation, but the most crucial is identifying the motive,"" he said. Razaruddin said the investigation was vital to ensuring national and public security. Police found six guns and 200 rounds of ammunition when they arrested the 36-year-old Israeli man at a hotel in Ampang, Selangor. Later that day, police also arrested a local married couple suspected of supplying firearms to the Israeli."

"Two lawyers, client get 7 days jail for filing false evidence",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"April 2, 2024 @ 4:51pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Two lawyers and their client were sentenced to seven days' imprisonment for contempt for filing false evidence four years ago. Sessions Court judge Halilah Suboh meted out the sentence against lawyer Mark Robin Tallala and G. Mahadeva, as well as their client, Jagmohan Singh Sandhu, today. The court allowed the trio's stay of execution pending their appeal at the High Court. Halilah, in her judgment, said all court officers have a responsibility not to mislead the court by presenting false evidence. She said each of the officers of the court has a heavy burden in carrying out their duties and roles based on principles of law and justice. ""As lawyers, justice is owed not only to their respective clients but also to the public and the court. This also becomes the duty of respondents as defence counsel and lawyers. ""In this case, the witness statement was intentionally and dishonestly filed. ""The respondents knew that the witness statement was not the actual statement given to the witness. Therefore, they (respondents) deliberately misled this court."" She said if the matter had not been noticed and disclosed before the trial, the impugned statement would have been sued during the trial, and disrupted and compromised the fairness of the case. She said preventive measures should be imposed on the respondents. ""Regarding the argument that the respondents only need to apologise, the court found that the apology should have been made at an early stage, as soon as the committal application was filed. ""The court believes that a prison sentence is appropriate, suitable, and reasonable. A fine would not be appropriate for the respondents as it would not reflect the seriousness of the offence,"" she said. The trio were found guilty by the Court of Appeal in October last year of filing a false witness statement for Allen David Martinez without approval at the Sessions Court. The appellate court said lawyers should not put their own words or narratives into the mouth of a witness, and that this was a ""basic rule of law and ethics"". The court has ordered the case to be remitted back to the Sessions Court for contempt proceedings to proceed. The false evidence came to light after Martinez filed an affidavit in 2020, denying every answer in the impugned witness statement. He also said he did not communicate with nor meet the lawyers before the filing of the impugned document. Tallala and Mahadeva later admitted to having never met or sought Martinez's personal confirmation before the filing of the impugned witness statement. They blamed Jagmohan and said they relied solely on their client's instructions and the supposition that the latter had finalised the contents of the impugned witness statement with Martinez."
Shafee challenges witness to prove Najib was a 'monster' to 1MDB board,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"April 2, 2024 @ 4:00pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Senior lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah today challenged the key prosecution witness in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MBD) trial to prove that Datuk Seri Najib Razak was a ""monster"" who controlled the board of directors like ""lambs to a slaughterhouse"". This came after former 1MDB general counsel Jasmine Loo Ai Swan told the court that the board of directors had blindly followed the former prime minister, who is the sole shareholder of the company. Shafee disagreed with Loo's statement and asked her why the board of directors did not exercise their own judgment instead of blindly following Najib's decisions. Loo said under Article 117 of 1MDB's Memorandum and Articles of Association, all decisions involving substantial transactions require the approval of the then prime minister. Shafee: My client, who was the finance minister at that time, did it in accordance with the law. He took note of the directors and gave his approval, as stated in Article 117 as the shareholder, so where is the inconsistency? Where is the paper that made the (then) PM a monster and (that) he led the poor directors who were like lambs to the slaughterhouse? Loo: Although it is not said specifically in (Article) 117, but in substance, the individual was the same. 1MDB treated the shareholder (Najib) in his capacity as prime minister and shareholder. Article 117 stipulates that the prime minister has the final say on Memorandum and Articles of Association amendments or the appointment and dismissal of directors and the highest management of 1MDB. It also states that any investment, financial and structuring decision involving the company's interests that are closely related to any national interest, security and government policy must obtain written approval from the prime minister. The trial before presiding judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah was cut short as Najib suffered from diarrhoea. Kajang Prison health clinic medical officer Dr Mohd Hafiz Mohd Hoshni testified that Najib had reported experiencing a stomachache and visited the washroom three times this morning. Deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib brought Dr Mohd Hafiz to the court after being notified about Najib's illness by the prison authority during the court's short break. ""He is weak, tired and dehydrated. I prescribed him Buscopan, Lomotil and oral rehydration salt,"" he said, adding that Najib's blood pressure was low. Sequerah agreed to adjourn today's proceedings and ordered the trial to resume tomorrow (April 3). Najib, 70, is standing trial on 25 charges of abuse of power and money laundering involving 1MDB funds amounting to RM2.28 billion."

Kelantanese told to exercise caution when visiting south Thailand,Sharifah Mahsinah Abdullah,"April 2, 2024 @ 3:11pm","KOTA BARU: Police advised Kelantanese to exercise extra caution when visiting southern Thailand in light of coordinated attacks by suspected insurgents in four southern provinces of the country recently. Kelantan police chief Datuk Muhamad Zaki Harun said other Malaysians should also be on alert following the latest development in the kingdom. ""I believe locals can make their own judgement over the situation in the border country. """"If there is no urgent matter or emergency, I would like to advice locals to postpone their visits to southern Thailand for now,"" he said. The state police was also obtaining information from its Thai counterpart on the latest situation in the country, he said. On Sunday, Malaysian Consul-General in Songkhla, Ahmad Fahmi Ahmad Sarkawi advised Malaysians residing in or visiting southern Thailand to exercise caution in light of the coordinated attacks by suspected insurgents in four southern provinces of the country. He had said so far, the situation in Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat and Songkhla provinces were under control. He also said the local security authorities were doing their utmost to monitor the situation and to nab those responsible for the attacks. Ahmad Fahmi also urged Malaysians to follow the advice and latest developments from Thai authorities when they were in these provinces. He highlighted the rend of attacks in these past years and noted an increase in activities during Ramadan in these provinces. ""One reason for this could be to commemorate past events, but they also want to make people aware,"" he had said. He also said such attacks, to some extent, hindered Malaysian investors from going into the provinces and disrupted development. On March 22, suspected insurgents staged coordinated attacks and committed arson in at least 39 locations across four provinces. One of the attacks reportedly killed a worker at a popular convenience store in Pattani following explosions caused by homemade bombs. A total of 20 attacks were reported in Pattani, 11 in Yala, six in Narathiwat, and two in Songkhla."
Judge ticks off Guan Eng's counsel for repeatedly asking same questions from star prosecution witness,Dawn Chan,"April 2, 2024 @ 2:39pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A Sessions Court judge today warned the lead defence counsel in Lim Guan Eng's corruption case against asking repeated questions when cross-examining star prosecution witness, former Consortium Zenith Construction Sdn Bhd (CZCSB) director Datuk Zarul Ahmad Mohd Zulkifli. Judge Azura Alwi told off counsel Haijan Omar for asking the same questions over and over but with different words during the proceedings to challenge Zarul's credibility. It was sparked when Haijan had repeatedly put to Zarul that the source of RM2.3 million banked into CZCSB's bank account from Vizione Construction Sdn Bhd were not proceeds from the sale of a piece of land. The insistent questioning from Haijan, however, riled up Azura, who said the defence counsel already had the facts of the case and there was no need to ask the same matter again. ""You are just going around using different words. You said you have more parts on the impeachment. ""If we go on at this pace, I do not know when we are going to finish this,"" she said. Haijan, however, told Azura that he would be able to finish the cross-examination and there was no need for her to worry about it. ""I am not worried. But, I have to control my court. This is taking too long. You are going around (the questions) but using different words. ""From the start, I already have my facts but suddenly, you have become long-winded. I have lost my concentration and have lost focus, and I might lose my facts as well. ""So, you better think about what you are doing also. Perhaps, you want the witness to answer what you want. But at the end, you will have to shoulder the risks. I am giving you a warning on that,"" said Azura. In November last year, judge Azura granted Guan Eng's application to commence impeachment proceedings against Zarul. In January this year, Guan Eng, who is former Penang chief minister, obtained a witness statement to challenge the credibility of Zarul, one of the star witnesses in the ongoing trial of the Penang undersea tunnel project corruption case. CZCSB was the company awarded the RM6.34 billion Penang undersea tunnel project. The defence had all this while contended that Zarul had made contradicting statements when testifying as a key witness in Guan Eng's trial. He is facing four charges of using his position as the then chief minister to solicit gratification to help Zarul's company secure the undersea tunnel project. He was alleged to have sought a 10 per cent take of the profit to be made by the company from Zarul and accused of receiving RM3.3 million for himself and causing two plots of land belonging to the state government to be disposed of to two companies linked to the project. Earlier, the proceedings also got a little heated when co-defence counsel R.S.N. Rayer pressed Zarul if he had lied in a statement he had given to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission in January 2018. Zarul said he was being accused of being a liar and Rayer ticked off the former for looking at lead deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin and not at the judge when answering the court. Wan Shaharuddin objected to this, saying that he was not looking at Zarul and that the defence had been using the same argument since the proceedings began. To this, Azura ordered the court to move on with the proceedings and ruled that both parties could put in their submissions later. ""Don't tell me you want to argue here until afternoon, until the time to break fast? It will not finish as both parties will want to state their opinion. ""I will assess the evidence disclosed before me. When you all argue and are triggered, you still will not get an answer,"" she said."

USM pathology graduates take MMC to court over specialist registration,New Straits Times,"April 1, 2024 @ 8:18pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Six pathology graduates from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) are pursuing a judicial review against the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) in their bid to be registered as specialists. Their action followed the MMC's decision to deny their enrollment in the National Specialist Register (NSR), which they then could not practise as specialists in the country. In the affidavit seen by the media, the plaintiffs argued that the MMC's refusal to include them in the NSR was ""unreasonable and irrational"", and constituted misconduct by the medical regulator. They contended that not being listed on the NSR would hinder their career and potentially disqualify them from pursuing sub-specialisation in medical genetic pathology. ""The MMC's decision has significantly affected our livelihood and has broader implications for public medical services,"" they said. Thus, the six doctors are seeking intervention from the High Court to overturn the MMC's decision, assert their compliance with registration requirements, and compel the regulator to register them. The judicial review application was submitted to the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Nov 16 last year, with the court granting leave on Jan 3. The case is scheduled for hearing on June 20. The doctors argued that despite the USM programme being recognised by relevant ministries and accredited by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA), the MMC had refused to acknowledge their qualifications. The MMC, citing Section 14 of the Medical Act 1971, contended that the USM programme did not meet their criteria for inclusion in the NSR. ""The government fully funded the four-year programme through scholarships, with graduates obligated to serve a seven-year bond. Failure to register us with the NSR undermines the purpose of these scholarships and the publicly-funded USM programme,"" the plaintiffs said. ""Furthermore, the government continues to offer scholarships for enrollment in the Master of Pathology (Medical Genetics) programme at USM. MMC's refusal to register specialists from this programme is unjustifiable, unreasonable and irrational."" In response, MMC chief executive officer Dr Anas Hussain defended the regulator's decision not to recognise the doctors, citing compliance with the Medical Act 1971's requirements. Dr Anas attributed the issue to USM's failure to register its genetics pathology programme for recognition as a specialist course and postgraduate qualification, as mandated by a 2017 amendment to the Medical Act. ""MMC is not obliged to recognise the course solely because the students were government-sponsored,"" Dr Anas said. The six applicants are represented by Lee Hishammuddin Allen & Gledhill, while Kanesh Sundrum & Co are representing the MMC."

On Feb 21, the civil High Court judge Datuk Atan Mustaffa Yussof Ahmad instructed the former lawyer to file her defence before April 22. The sovereign wealth funds also named former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, former chief financial officer Terrence Geh Choh Heng, former executive director Casey Tang Keng Chee, and former chief investment officer Vincent Beng as defendants. Also named were former chief operating officer Radhi Mohamad, former investment director Kelvin Tan Kay Jim, and former SRC International Bhd chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil. The plaintiffs asserted that the defendants committed breach of trust, breached statutory duties, abused power, conspired, and misappropriated 1MDB funds.

""The company was created by Tarek Obaid, one of my very best friends in 2005. This company has only one good asset... the name. It sounds like a Saudi government company. ""But from 2006 until the 1MDB money went into the PetroSaudi account, it was almost a non-existence company. ""In Geneva, they were hiring a part-time employee. I know that because he was stationed in my office. ""In Saudi Arabia, which was supposed to be the center of the business, there was only one guy picking up the phone while in London, three oilmen were paid part-time.

He said the police discovered the viral video last Friday showing the actions of a disabled person who was advised by the Ramadan bazaar trader to leave after he was found promoting gambling and loan shark activities. Mohd Yusri said the result of the investigation found that the man admitted to visiting the Ramadan bazaar with two other men whom he hired to distribute and promote his loan shark business which has operated since 2022. He said the two men with him at the bazaar during the incident were disabled persons who were hired to distribute promotion cards for the illegal activities for RM30 each. ""Acting on information, the husband and wife suspects, who are the real masterminds behind the case, were successfully traced and arrested, with the police also seizing a mobile phone, a list of loan recipients, a car, and 120 cards advertising online gambling and loan shark services. An examination based on the seized list found that 90 percent of the loan recipients from the suspects are those residing around the Manjung district.

"Court annuls RM66,000 wrongful dismissal award for ex-US Embassy security guard",Bernama,"April 1, 2024 @ 3:25pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court today allowed a judicial review application filed by the United States (US) government to annul an RM66,000 award given by the Industrial Court to a former security guard at the US Embassy here for wrongful dismissal. Judge Datuk Amarjeet Singh, in allowing the application, said the court found the applicant (the US government) and its embassy have immunity and are protected from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court over the claim by former security guard L. Subramaniam under Section 20 (3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967. ""Therefore, the court allows the judicial review. The second respondent (Subramaniam) has to pay costs of RM8,000,"" said the judge in a decision delivered via email. Lawyers Lim Heng Seng and Summer Chong Yue Han represented the US government, while Subramaniam was represented by lawyer Ragunath Kesavan and senior federal counsel Liew Horng Bin represented the Attorney General as amicus curiae or friend of the court. The US government filed the application on Aug 9 last year, naming the Industrial Court and Subramaniam as the first and second respondents.  It sought an order for the High Court to annul the award given by the Industrial Court in 2023 to Subramaniam. The US government also sought a court order that Subramaniam's dismissal for internal disciplinary misconduct was within the embassy, saying that the country and its embassy are protected by immunity from the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court concerning claims under Section 20(3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1967. On Jan 8, 2020, the High Court ruled that the US government and its embassy were protected by immunity and prohibited the Industrial Court from adjudicating Subramaniam's unlawful dismissal claim case. However, in 2021, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's decision and ordered the Industrial Court to proceed with hearing the dispute, prompting the US government to bring the matter up to the Federal Court, but the appeal was rejected. On April 27 last year, the Industrial Court ordered the US Embassy to pay RM66,000 to Subramaniam after finding that he was unlawfully dismissed. Subramaniam had been a security guard at the embassy for more than ten years before he was terminated in 2008. Subramaniam claimed that he was merely performing auxiliary duties at the embassy and was not involved in the diplomatic functions or governmental decisions of the United States. He also contended that he had no access to confidential information or documents relating to the embassy or the US government. – BERNAMA"

Simultaneously, the suspects continued to fire shots, prompting the police to return fire in self-defence. Upon inspection, the suspects were found dead at the scene, and the police also discovered and seized two firearms used by the suspects along with other weapons. Sources revealed that all suspects had outstanding warrants issued by the police for armed robbery incidents and past criminal records. ""The suspects were reportedly actively involved in robbing cash from delivery company vans, factories, and homes storing cash and jewellery in areas around Shah Alam, Puchong, Klang, Subang Jaya, Kajang, and Sentul. ""The suspects were also found to have injured victims who attempted to resist them,"" the source said. Police believe that at the time of their arrest, all suspects had plans to commit armed robbery. A press conference will be held later today."
BREAKING: Malaysian couple arrested for allegedly supplying firearms to Israeli 'spy' [NSTTV],Safeek Affendy Razali,"March 30, 2024 @ 8:38am","KUALA LUMPUR: Police have arrested a local married couple suspected of supplying firearms to an Israeli national detained at a hotel on Jalan Ampang here. The 42 and 40-year-old couple were arrested by a team of officers and members of the Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at a Ramadan bazaar in Kuala Selangor, at 7.15pm last night. Upon their arrest, the police took the suspects to their residence, also in Kuala Selangor, where they found a pistol in a backpack inside their Honda Jazz car. According to sources, the male suspect is believed to be responsible for supplying six pistols to the Israeli man– suspected of being a spy– who entered the country using a French passport. It is understood that the couple will be remanded today for further investigation. Earlier, police also arrested a local man in Cameron Highlands, Pahang, believed to be the driver for the Israeli man since his entry into the country on March 12. At this time, police are still conducting investigations to determine the main motive for the Israeli man's entry into the country besides his intention to possess six pistols and 200 rounds of ammunition. Yesterday, Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain, at a press conference, revealed the arrest of a 36-year-old Israeli suspect at a hotel on Jalan Ampang last Wednesday. He was reported to have said that, based on interrogation, the suspect claimed to have come to this country to find an individual, also from his country, to be allegedly killed, purportedly related to a family issue, but the police do not believe the claim."

The Israeli was found with six firearms and 200 rounds of ammunition.

""Given what is happening in Palestine and Israel, we are on alert, especially on security aspects. We will be raising the level of security for the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ibrahim and Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim,"" he said at a breaking of fast event here today. Anwar has consistently championed the plight of the Palestinians, having spoken on the issue on various platforms, including during his recent official visit to Germany. The prime minister had also previously reaffirmed Malaysia's position that the Palestinians deserved their own independent and sovereign state, based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. His criticism of Western countries' lack of action against Israel's atrocities in Gaza has also drawn support from prominent figures across various fields globally. Razarudin said the Israeli national had entered Malaysia on March 12 using a forged French passport. He said the man had obtained the weapons in KL and paid for them using cryptocurrency.

"BNM manager's 2017 sacking unlawful, High Court rules",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 29, 2024 @ 6:40pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The 2017 sacking of a former Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) manager for participating in political activities was unlawful, the High Court ruled today. Judge Datuk Ahmad Bache said BNM's internal inquiry conducted against Y. Kohila, involving three charges of breaching the employees' code was conducted unfairly, potentially undermining the integrity of the process. In May 2017, the plaintiff was served with a show cause letter by the central bank over her support to Parti Sosialis Malaysia (PSM) and participating in a public gathering organised by the party in 2016. After proceedings on May 30, 31, and June 2017, Kohila received a letter on July 19, 2017, stating that she was found guilty of all three charges and was instructed to leave BNM's premises within one hour. She filed an appeal on Aug 3, 2017, but was rejected on Sept 5, 2017. Dissatisfied with the result, she filed the lawsuit on July 9, 2018. Ahmad, in his judgment, said BNM during the inquiry had turned down Kohila's request for an external lawyer, to provide a witness statement as well as allowing an outside witness to testify in the proceedings. ""The plaintiff should be put as a defendant so she can defend herself, but the bank refused. ""She was put in a disadvantaged position... She did not have a chance to prepare for her defence during the inquiry. ""The plaintiff was not treated fairly. She did not have an opportunity to testify but only to be cross examined by the panelists,"" he said. Ahmad said the main witness for the bank also agreed that Kohila should be given documents to prepare herself for the proceedings. He said the proceeding (domestic inquiry) amounted to double standards and was not a smooth hearing as the plaintiff did not have time to answer her charges. ""There was no mitigation allowed against her... the procedure was seriously faulty. ""Had she been given the chance to litigate, it might have had a different result,"" he added. The court set April 29 to decide the amount for special, general, exemplary, and aggravated damages."

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said that investigations revealed a misunderstanding regarding the incident after their examination of closed-circuit television recordings of the supermarket. ""The investigation found that during the incident, the victim, along with her mother and her aunt were using an escalator which was malfunctioning at the time and the victim was seen having difficulty ascending the stairs. ""Coincidentally, two foreign men were near the victim and they lifted her with the intention of helping. ""However, this action was misunderstood by the victim's mother, who thought that her child was being abducted,"" he said at a press conference at the Selangor Police Contingent Headquarters (IPK) today.  He said that further investigation revealed the two foreign men were legally employed at a nearby factory and frequently visited the supermarket to purchase necessities. He added that the suspects also did not flee when detained by the public and further checks found no evidence of kidnapping preparations around the supermarket such as vehicles for abducting the victim. ""Nevertheless, we will complete the investigation papers and hand them over to the deputy public prosecutor for further action.""I also advise the public not to casually hold other people's children, especially those who are not known to them, as it can lead to misunderstandings and panic,"" he said. Media reported last Monday that a mother experienced a terrifying moment when her baby daughter was allegedly attempted to be taken by two foreign men at the supermarket. Meanwhile, commenting on the discovery of over RM500,000 in cash found in the trunk of a car parked at a shopping centre in Damansara last week, Hussein said the individual claiming the money belonged to his company has yet to come forward to provide statements.

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said the individuals in their 20s and 30s were arrested in raids around Gombak between March 20 and 22. He said those detained included 15 Malaysians, including four women, and one Nigerian woman. ""Investigations revealed that among those arrested were individuals playing roles as bank card collectors, runners who sought individuals willing to open accounts, and middlemen between the syndicate and local bank officers. ""Police seized 31 mobile phones, 30 ATM cards from various banks, a printing machine, laptop and one file containing various documents. ""Checks found that one local suspect was believed to be the mastermind behind the syndicate, and he has a criminal record under the Prevention of Crime Act 1959 (POCA) in 2021,"" Hussein told a press conference at the Selangor police headquarters here today. He said the syndicate was believed to have been active for the past six months and offered one-off payments ranging from RM500 to RM1,500 to people who opened accounts and sold them to them. He said the purchased bank accounts and ATM cards were then rented out or sold to syndicates engaged in fraudulent activities nationwide and they received proceeds from these things. ""Investigations into the two bank employees working as mobile deposit specialists (MDS) found that they did it to achieve their key performance indicators (KPIs). ""They registered bank accounts for individuals without conducting thorough checks. Investigations found a total of 40 accounts were opened by the two bank officers.""

All transactions took place between February and March. He said police would call in the account owners for further investigation. The cases were being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating involving delivery of property and Section 120B of the same code for criminal conspiracy.

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan expressed optimism that the individual will keep his promise to provide a statement, having failed to do so previously for various reasons. ""On March 21, we received a complaint from the individual who pledged to come to the station and give a statement after admitting the suitcase belonged to their company. ""We've just been informed that that he will come tomorrow, March 30, with evidence proving ownership,"" he told a press conference here today. Hussein emphasised the importance of recording the individual's statement and assessing the evidence before determining who rightfully owns the suitcase. He added that if necessary, the police would follow standard procedures, such as publishing notices in newspapers to locate the rightful owner or refer the matter to the Attorney General's Chambers to return the money to the government. Earlier the media reported a security guard found a suitcase with over RM500,000 in cash last Wednesday and on the same day, an IT company director claimed it belonged to their company at Damansara police station, but to date the individual has not provided a statement as requested. In another development, Hussein said the investigation into two foreign men suspected of trying to kidnap a one-year-seven-month-old girl at a supermarket in Klang last Tuesday concluded that it wasn't an abduction attempt. He said it was more of a misunderstanding and a quick response from the child's mother to protect her daughter. ""The police, including myself, have reviewed CCTV footage of the incident. The two foreigners didn't try to escape when the mother intervened and the public caught them. ""Further investigation revealed that these men, with valid travel documents, worked nearby and often shopped at the supermarket. There were no signs of a planned abduction, like someone waiting outside. He said the incident happened as the child, her mother and aunt were on a non-working escalator. The men behind them tried to help the child onto it, but panicked when the mother reacted. Despite this, the police will complete the investigation and involve the public prosecutor if any legal issues arise. – BERNAMA"

When asked about the possibility of the Israeli man being a coordinator for a plot to kill Eran, Razarudin said the investigation was looking into every possible angle. ""We're examining how a foreigner coming to Malaysia could obtain six firearms within a few days of being here, so we're looking at all angles. ""He could be a coordinator or perhaps an armourer or just came to acquire weapons. ""So those are all angles of our investigation, but the most crucial is identifying the motive,"" he said. Razaruddin said the investigation was vital to ensuring national and public security.

Later that day, police also arrested a local married couple suspected of supplying firearms to the Israeli."
"A suspect must be brought to court for remand application within 24 hours of arrest, High Court rules",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 29, 2024 @ 2:03pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A suspect must be brought to court for a remand application within 24 hours of their arrest, the High Court in Johor Baru ruled recently. Judicial Commissioner Kan Weng Hin said this is to ensure that the fundamental right to liberty of a person under Article 5 of the Federal Constitution is upheld and protected. ""It is noted that in certain circumstances, it may be administratively difficult to satisfy the mandatory 24-hour requirement, for instance, if it falls within the early hours of the morning or late at night since the court sits only during normal office hours. ""In order for the constitutional right of the detainee to be recognised, it is imperative that the relevant stakeholders work together to provide for such a situation. ""There should not be any delay or postponement of it due to an administrative issue or requirement,"" he said in his broad grounds published on judicial website on Monday. Kan made the ruling before releasing S. Thineshbalan who was seeking a revision of magistrate court's order to remand him issued the previous day. Thineshbalan was arrested for investigation under Section 186 of the Penal Code on Feb 4 at 6am following a car chase along Jalan Permas Utara after he refused to stop when ordered by the police during a routine police operation. Police filed an application to remand the detainee at 3.42pm on the same day (Feb 4) until Feb 7 under Section 117 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) at the magistrate court. The detainee was brought to court at around 9am on Feb 5 and the remand application was heard and disposed of during the course of the day by the magistrate. Consequently, the magistrate granted an extension to the remand of the detainee to Feb 6. The detainee's lawyer who was present at the hearing objected to the application on the grounds that it had exceeded the 24 hours as provided under Section 28 and Section 117 of the CPC. Not happy with the decision, Thineshbalan's lawyer wrote to the High Court to seek a revision of magistrate's decision on Feb 5. Kan said the magistrate plays an important role to ensure that the detention of the detainee beyond 24 hours after his arrest is not as a result of an executive act. ""The time occupied in the journey from the place of arrest to the magistrate is not to be counted as part of the 24 hours. ""This raises an interesting issue as normally the detainee would be brought to the police station first to be processed after the arrest. ""It is left to the discretion of the magistrate to decide what would be a necessary time for the journey from the place of arrest. ""Hence, the learned magistrate needs to address his or her judicial mind to determine the time necessary for the journey. ""With the advent of software applications like Waze and Google maps, the magistrate should be able to seek assistance from it to determine what should be the necessary time for the journey,"" he said. The court said there was some flexibility regarding the venue for the remand hearing, as prior to 2021, such applications were typically heard either in court or occasionally at the police station."
Court orders Isa Samad and former FGV CEO Emir to compensate FGV RM3.3 million,Dawn Chan,"March 29, 2024 @ 1:08pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The High Court today ordered former FGV Holdings Bhd (FGV) chairman Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad and its former group president and chief executive officer, Datuk Mohd Emir Mavani Abdullah, to compensate a total of RM3.3 million to the company for wrongful use of two luxury condominium units. In an online proceedings, Judge Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin ruled that the duo had wrongfully used the Troika condominium units on Persiaran KLCC while Emir had also misused the company cars and petrol benefits. Isa and Emir were ordered to compensate RM990,502.61 and RM2,322,705.86 respectively to FGV. The judge said the court found that FGV, as the plaintiff, failed to prove that the acquisition of the condominium units priced at RM12 million, at the material time, was wrongful. He said Isa and Emir, who were the first and second defendants respectively, did not breach their duties as the purchase of the condominium units was in accordance with the resolution of the board of FGV. ""Secondly, even if I am wrong, the company did not suffer or has not suffered any damages over the acquisition of the units as it is still owned by the plaintiff and no losses have been realised. ""Thirdly, the defendants did wrongfully use the units and wrongfully caused the units to be furnished not in accordance with the procedures of the company. ""They have also put their intrerest in conflict with the company and did not act in the best interest of the plaintiff,"" he said. The judge added that Emir had breached his duties by abusing the carpool system and abused the petrol card. ""They both should be liable for damages."" Isa's compensation consists of losses of use of Unit A which amounted to RM221,200; RM295,130 for cost of furnishing; RM184,172.61 for expenses incurred; and RM300,000 exemplary damages as he was the chairman and director of the company. Emir's compensation was made up of losses of use of Unit B for 11 months and 16 days amounting to RM68,400; RM207,505.18 for cost of furnishing, RM97,591.95 for expenses incurred; RM1,444,371 .63 for cost of pool cars; RM10,837.10 for petrol card and RM500,000 in exemplary damages. FGV, as the plaintiff through a statement to Bursa Malaysia on Nov 30, 2018, had clarified that the suit filed against the two defendants was related to the purchase of the luxury condo units at Troika, Persiaran KLCC at above market price. The company said the suit was also related to the abuse of company vehicle and petrol benefit by Emir. FGV sought damages against the defendants, including RM4.54 million for the total acquisition, use and possession of Troika units, RM3.14 million in relation to the pool of cars and RM10.84 million for petrol benefit against Emir. In addition, the company sought interest at the rate of five per cent per annum on damages awarded, starting from the date of filing of the suit until the date of full and final settlement."

The arrests were made by the MACC's Anti-Money Laundering unit following Operation Samba 2.0, which was carried out in collaboration with the LHDN and BNM beginning March 11.

""Previously, the court found you (the accused) guilty and convicted under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. ""Therefore, after considering the mitigation appeal presented through your lawyer and the aggravating factors raised by the prosecution, I have decided to impose a 30-year jail sentence from the date of arrest and 12 strokes,"" she said. According to the charge, Muhammad Nur Arif, who was then a student at a private university in Selangor, was found trafficking cannabis weighing 1,900.9 grammes in the parking lot of a supermarket in this district at around 5.30 pm on Sept 2, 2020. The offence was committed under Section 39B (1) (a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and punishable under Section 39B (2) of the same act. A total of 10 witnesses were called to the stand throughout the trial, which commenced on April 10 last year. Earlier, lawyer Shah Rizal Abdul Manan appealed that a prison sentence be imposed on his client, taking into account the accused's young age and his promising future upon release, as well as the fact that this was his first offence. However, deputy public prosecutor Ala'uddin Baharom requested the death penalty, taking into account the public interest, including preventive factors, punishment and the accused's guilt in the case. ""This is a case of trafficking, and it can be proven directly without any presumption. Whether it is a soft or high drug, it does not matter because the negative effects remain the same. ""That is why the country prohibits all drug-related activities unless licenced. In this case, the accused is a university student and should be aware of the consequences and effects of involvement in drugs,"" he said. -- Bernama"

"Probe instigators in 'socks' issue, says LFL",New Straits Times,"March 28, 2024 @ 10:32am","KUALA LUMPUR: A human rights group today said it was dangerous to let politicians baselessly carry on the narrative that the religion is under attack, and urged for key persons making inciting or instigating statements to be investigated. Lawyers for Liberty director Zaid Malek called for all those who incited or instigated the public to face the full force of the law, urging action to prevent a recurrence of the events of past weeks, and to demonstrate that no one is above the law. He said there was a long history of politicians using religious or racial issues for political gain in the country. ""Aren't we all sick of it? Will the PH-led Madani government tolerate this just like previous governments did? ""It is dangerous to let politicians baselessly carry on the narrative that the religion is under attack. These kinds of statements from persons who have political standing and influence can have far-reaching impact on public order and tranquility."" Zaid said a statement yesterday by Criminal Investigations Department Director Mohd Zain who urged everyone, including politicians, to not incite racial sentiments regarding issue of the socks bearing the word 'Allah', had come late in the day. ""For weeks the statements of an inciting and inflammatory nature were made by politicians with little reaction from the authorities. ""Eventually, this resulted in a petrol bomb attack at a KK Mart store. ""The public and businesses were also put in fear due to artificial ratcheting up of tensions by politicians. The entire debate over the socks was pointless, superfluous and dangerous. No reasonable person in this country thinks that this incident was anything but a supply error on the part of the business implicated. ""Having called for calm, are the police going to do the right thing and probe those who created the tense situation by framing the issue as an attack on Islam? Or do the culprits who turned the country upside down for a fortnight get away with it? ""It is public knowledge that a key person responsible for the build-up of tension was Umno Youth Chief, Dr Muhamad Akmal Saleh, who was relentless in playing up the issue, even after the business had made public apologies and criminal charges had been brought against them. There may be others involved as well."" ""It does not matter if the person responsible comes from a government political party. All responsible must face the law. ""Potential offences have been committed under section 505 (b) and (c) of the Penal Code for making statements that can cause fear or alarm to any section of the public and cause disturbance against public order or which incites one community against another community.

"Najib portrayed as 'grand chess master', ex-SRC director tells court",Dawn Chan,"March 27, 2024 @ 6:39pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former SRC International Sdn Bhd director Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi told the High Court today that he had been misled by Datuk Seri Najib Razak and Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil on the true nature and purpose of the RM4 billion fund from the Retirement Fund Inc (KWAP) loan. Shahrol said at that material time, he trusted Najib, who is former prime minister and SRC emeritus adviser and former chief executive officer Nik Faisal, who had informed him that SRC was established to carry out strategic investment for the interests of Malaysia. Najib was SRC's emeritus adviser from May 1, 2012, until March 4, 2019. ""Bear in mind Najib was then the prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia. I was also informed that for the purpose of such projects, SRC would require a lot of funds and hence, the need to apply to KWAP for a loan. ""After the loan was approved and disbursed by KWAP, Nik Faisal informed me that SRC was inter alia working on two big coal mines investment in Indonesia and Mongolia and it was necessary to remit the KWAP loan as soon as possible in order not to miss out on good investment opportunities. ""Najib and Nik Faisal made false and misleading representations to the SRC directors, including me, regarding the true nature and purpose for the disbursements of the RM4 billion fund from KWAP loan,"" he said in his witness statement before judge Datuk Ahmad Fairuz Zainol Abidin. Shahrol was testifying as the fourth person named in the list of third-party respondents in the US$1.18 billion SRC International civil suit against Najib. Shahrol said at the material time, there was no reasonable ground for him to suspect that anything dubious or questionable was going on in SRC. ""To the best of my recollection, I remember telling Nik Faisal in respect of the disbursement of the KWAP loan that in view of the colossal sums involved, the relevant investment projects which he mentioned should be carried out as soon as possible,"" he added. He denied Najib's allegation that he was guilty of acts, omissions, wrongdoings, breaches of duties and conduct which constitute the effective and actual cause of any purported loss and damage claimed to be suffered by the SRC. ""In view of the absolute power and control exercised by Najib over the SRC, I reiterate that my duty and role as a director only exists in name and could not be exercised by me in reality,"" he said. On June 7, 2018, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said it was hunting for Nik Faisal as well as Low Taek Jho to be investigated in the SRC scandal. In 2020, police sought Interpol's help to extradite Nik Faisal who was hiding in Hong Kong with his wife and child. Meanwhile, Shahrol described Najib as having the style of a ""grand chess master"" who ""moved things around on the board"" when it came to facilitating projects for SRC as well as 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). He cited an example in relation to SRC when uranium was put into its mandate and around 2010, there was already a plan to diversify electricity sources. ""Sure enough, a separate company called the Malaysian Power Nuclear Corporation was set up around that year to kickstart the nuclear programme in Malaysia and transformed into Nuclear Energy Plan Implementation directly under the prime minister's department. ""So these were all the 'moving pieces'. And even in my experience within 1MDB, we noticed that when we are mandated to execute a project, there would be other 'chess pieces' that were also moving to complement or synergise with what we were doing,"" he answered to a question from defence counsel Muhammad Farhan Shafee. Shahrol disagreed with Farhan who had put it to him that Najib did not have a freehand in the appointment and removal of any SRC director."

It is unknown whether he has been granted permanent residency in the country where he currently resides. Ganesparan, he said, had been charged in absentia in 2021 for insulting the then Yang Dipertuan Agong and Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. ""For the two (new) reports that we received for his latest videos that went viral, they will be investigated and similar action will be taken (charged in absentia).

"2 lawyers, client in contempt of court for filing false evidence",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 27, 2024 @ 2:41pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Two lawyers and their client, who were found guilty of contempt by the Court of Appeal for filing false evidence, will receive their sentence next month. Sessions Court judge Halilah Suboh fixed April 2 for sentencing. The case involves lawyers Mark Robin Tallala and G. Mahadeva, as well as their client Jagmohan Singh Sandhu. In October last year, a three-member bench led by Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera found the trio guilty of filing a false witness statement for Allen David Martinez without approval at the Sessions Court four years ago. Other members of the bench were Datuk Seri Mariana Yahya and Datuk Azimah Omar. Then, the court said they disagreed with the lower court's finding that the filing of the impugned witness statement was merely a ""mistake"". ""The impugned document was knowingly filed notwithstanding the full knowledge that the solicitors have not communicated, consulted, nor have met Martinez,"" the court said in its judgment. ""The solicitors knew they had not obtained proper confirmation from the intended witness and yet they found it acceptable to ignore the absence of personal confirmation. ""Instead, the solicitors felt it was appropriate to just rely on the instructions and confirmation of their client."" The false evidence came to light after Martinez filed an affidavit in 2020 denying every answer in the impugned witness statement. He also said he did not communicate nor meet the lawyers before the filing of the impugned document. Tallala and Mahadeva later admitted to having never met or sought Martinez personal confirmation before the filing of the impugned witness statement. They blamed Jagmohan and said they relied solely on their client's instruction and the supposition that the latter had finalised the contents of the impugned witness statement with Martinez. The court said lawyers cannot entrust their client with the responsibility of obtaining confirmation from witnesses. It said this showed the lawyer's conduct went beyond a ""mistake"" and encroached on the realm of inconsiderate presumptions and dishonesty. ""It is not the contents nor the veracity of the contents of the impugned document that irritates and offended the face of the Court, but it was the callous conduct of the solicitors in filing the impugned witness statement that accords contempt of court."" The court said even though the impugned witness statement would not be admissible as evidence as it was unsigned, it still did not erase the solicitors' contemptuous conduct of improperly filing the document. ""There has never been a rule or precedent that contempt follows the event or outcome of the main litigation nor should there ever be such a rule of law. ""Contempt remains contempt no matter how meritorious the case of the contemnor (or contemnor's client) would be.   ""Whether the witness statement was later signed and admitted before the court is distinctly a separate matter."" The court said lawyers should not put their own words or narratives into the mouth of a witness, and that this was a ""basic rule of law and ethics"". The court has ordered the case to be remitted back to the Sessions Court for contempt proceedings to proceed. In today's proceedings at the Sessions Court, lawyer Datuk Harpal Singh Grewal who appeared for Tallala and Mahadeva said any custodial sentence against his clients would have very serious consequences for their future. ""This is an extensive mistake for the solicitors to learn. Tallala comes from a very respectable family and has been in practice for 21 years, while Mahadeva was just assisting his senior and was not very instrumental in filing the affidavit. ""This is the first time in my career that I have come across a case where an unsigned witness statement can be the subject of contempt. ""The impugned witness statement was never utilised by both parties and the defendant in the trial was not prejudiced by the unsigned witness statement,"" he said in his mitigation. Jagmohan's lawyer Ratni Jebaratham said her client was just a layman who did not understand the court's procedure for filing evidence. ""Even though my client has a law degree, he never practices and only provides consultation services,"" she said. However, Bhavanash Sharma, the petitioner in the case, argued for a deterrent sentence, citing the contemnors' dishonesty and deceitfulness towards the court. ""They have never issued an apology and fought this case until the Court of Appeal. This is not just a mistake; it is fraud in the court,"" said Bhavanash, who was assisted by Chetna Brijmohan ""A custodial sentence must be imposed so that it will not be a mockery of the appellate court's decision,"" he said."

CID director tells all quarters to stand down in regards to 'Allah' socks issue [NSTTV],Aliza Shah,"March 27, 2024 @ 1:52pm","KUALA LUMPUR: ""All parties should stand down."" This was the strong warning issued by Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain, who wants everyone – including politicians – to stop playing around with sensitive issues related to the 3R (race, religion, and royalty). The Federal Police Criminal Investigation Department director said the police will open investigation papers on every report related to 3R cases. ""It doesn't matter if the report is against the government (parliamentarians) or otherwise. We have been consistent about opening investigation papers; we have both investigation papers on the government parliamentarians and the opposition. ""We will investigate all,"" he told a press conference at Bukit Aman today. The issue of socks bearing the word ""Allah"" displayed at a KK Mart outlet recently sparked public outrage. A branch of the convenience store in Perak was also the target of what is believed to be a Molotov cocktail attack yesterday. Shuhaily said the police will enhance their investigations to detect any attempts to worsen the situation. He also warned people against spreading old issues. ""I would like to take this opportunity to advise everyone, please stand down. Do not escalate this. Enough is enough. ""I have to give it to KJ (Khairy Jamaluddin) who spoke about this (asking politicians to stand down) in his podcast yesterday. I think that is the question. How far do we want to push this? (in relation to the KK Mart stockings controversy). ""Our side is quite concerned if there are incidents that do not involve racial issues, but involve two different groups that could fuel the issue. ""We don't want to see another Kampung Medan or any other racial incidences in this country because that will only worsen the state of the country and tarnish its image."" Shuhaily said those involved in the KK Mart controversy have been charged yesterday, and the public should let the justice system work. """"Let (them) go through the existing justice system. ""How we handle sensitive issues in this country will show the maturity of our people . ""We used to have preventive laws (Internal Security Act), and that was repealed because it reflects the maturity of society in discussing such sensitive matters. So today, we are tested on our maturity in handling such issues,"" he said, adding the police, with whatever power they have, will investigate all 3R cases. Yesterday five people were charged in relation to the KK Mart stockings controversy. Among them were KK Mart Group founder and executive chairman Datuk Chai Kee Kan and his wife Datin Loh Siew Mui, who both pleaded not guilty at the Shah Alam Sessions Court here with intentionally wounding the religious feelings of Muslims by displaying socks bearing the word ""Allah"" at its Bandar Sunway outlet. Shuhaily also warned any individuals against taking matters into their own hands. ""Taking matters into one's own hands will only harm oneself because remember, all crimes, when charged and convicted, the record will remain. ""I'm not trying to make you scared, but that will affect everyone's job prospects later on,"" he said."
Businessman claims trial to five counts of illegal deposit taking and cheating,Audrey Dermawan,"March 27, 2024 @ 1:17pm","BUTTERWORTH: A businessman was charged in two separate courts here today with five counts of illegal deposit taking and cheating amounting to RM1.295 million. R.G. Chandrasegaran Ganeson, 57, claimed trial to all the five charges which were read to him by the court interpreters before Sessions Court Judge Noor Aini Yusof and Magistrate Siti Zulaikha Nordin @ Ghani. In the Sessions Court, Chandrasegaran was charged with one count of receiving deposits totalling RM820,000 from one M. Sevanasparan, 53, without a valid license under Section 10 of the Financial Services Act 2013.

"Top court rules JF Apex Securities, Mercury Securities merger lawful, did not oppress Concrete Parade",Dawn Chan,"March 26, 2024 @ 7:53pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Federal Court denied the challenge by Concrete Parade Sdn Bhd, a dissenting minority shareholder of Apex Equity Holding Bhd, after ruling that a 2018 proposed merger between JF Apex Securities Bhd and Mercury Securities Sdn Bhd was lawful and did not oppress them.

The two other members of the bench were Federal Court judges Tan Sri Nallini Pathmanathan and Datuk Rhozariah Bujang.

To a question on whether the use of the oppression provision was the proper way to remedy Concrete Parade's grievances, the bench answered in the negative. ""The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the merger would 'unfairly prejudice' Concrete Parade as a shareholder because the value of its investments in Apex Equity would diminish. ""It failed to comprehend that the shareholders at a general meeting had voted in favour of the merger. If the majority approved the merger, how then was Concrete Parade unfairly prejudiced?

Jana Wibawa scandal: Contractor involved rated 4 stars by CIDB,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 26, 2024 @ 6:44pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Nepturis Sdn Bhd, the company implicated in the corruption trial involving the Jana Wibawa scandal, received a four-star rating from the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). CIDB assistant engineer Siti Nooraishah Zainal Abidin said a letter on behalf of Nepturis was issued from the board's construction industry information management system (CIMS) after the company applied for the contractor capability and performance assessment programme (SCORE). ""CIMS will generate a reference number for the SCORE application process. ""It was found that Nepturis had obtained a four-star rating based on re-examination of documents uploaded by the company. ""I can confirm that I have seen the CIDB SCORE letter on behalf of Nepturis dated Oct 26, 2021,"" she said. Nooraishah said this when testifying in the corruption and money laundering trial involving Tasek Gelugor member of parliament Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan involving the Jana Wibawa scandal. Nepturis is a company allegedly assisted by Wan Saiful in obtaining the Central Spine Road: Sertik ke Persimpangan Lebuhraya Pantai Timur project from the government through a pre-qualification process worth RM232 million. Deputy public prosecutor Siti Amirah Muhammad Ali during examination-in-chief asked the witness about the necessity for a company to obtain a star rating from CIDB. Nooraishah said the rating would provide recognition to contractors with capabilities and capacities, which would assist clients in selecting reputable contractors for their respective projects. The witness said in SCORE, CIDB would assess based on documents uploaded by contractors or companies including business performance, financial and technical capability as well as project management. She said besides assessing the capabilities of a company, CIDB would also check the status of a contractor company, whether it was Bumiputera-status or vice versa. ""However, I am not sure about the status of Nepturis because it is not within my job scope. I only manage the accreditation unit,"" she added. Wan Saiful, 47, is charged with soliciting a bribe from one Lian Tan Chuan as an inducement for him to help a company, Nepturis Sdn Bhd, secure the RM232 million-worth ""Central Spine Road: Sertik to East Coast Expressway Interchange"" project from the federal government. Wan Saiful is charged with receiving RM6,962,694.54, which was transferred from a Maybank Islamic Bhd account owned by Nepturis Sdn Bhd into a CIMB Bank Bhd account held by his company, WSA Advisory Group Sdn Bhd, as a reward for helping the company obtain a letter of acceptance for the project. He is alleged to have committed both offences at the Royal Lake Club, Taman Tasik Perdana here, in April last year and at CIMB Bank Bhd Bukit Tunku branch, Taman Tunku, Bukit Tunku here, between July 8 and Sept 30 last year. Wan Saiful was also charged with 18 counts of money laundering involving RM5.59 million by transferring and using the illegal proceeds to pay for the purchase of a Ford Ranger vehicle, making payments to the Malaysian National Sports Council as well as transferring money to several company accounts, including one belonging to Sinar Karangkraf Sdn Bhd."

MACC arrests 34 customs officers in RM2 billion smuggling scheme [NSTTV],Iylia Marsya Iskandar,"March 29, 2024 @ 11:46am","PUTRAJAYA: The Malaysia Anti Corruption Commission (MACC) has detained 34 customs officers suspected of being involved in the smuggling of contraband items resulting in losses of more than RM2 billion for the country. MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said the contraband tobacco, cigarettes, and liquor were smuggled Kuala Lumpur International Airport Cargo, Sepang. ""The officers are in their 30s to 50s and include those ranging from Grades 19 (assistant enforcement officers) to 44 (assistant director),"" he said at a press conference, here, today. Azam said the officers involved allegedly received bribes in exchange for allowing cargo to pass through without checks. ""These Customs officers were found to have received bribes totaling over RM 4.7 million from syndicates to facilitate the smuggling of chewing tobacco, cigarettes, alcohol, health products, and vehicle spare parts. ""An examination of import documents (K1) involving the syndicate-owned importing companies indicate the government has lost between RM1.5 billion to RM2 billion in revenue over two years."" However, Azam said as the syndicate has been active since 2017, the loss of revenue could well exceed RM2 billion. Also in attendance was MACC's Anti-Money Laundering unit director Datuk Mohamad Zamri Zainul Abidin. MACC also arrested 27 people and business owners involved in the smuggling following a six-month investigation. The case is being investigated under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act for corporate liability. The arrests were made by the MACC AML unit following Operation Samba 2.0, which was carried out in collaboration with the Inland Revenue Board and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) beginning March 11. The syndicate's modus operandi includes utilising forwarding agents as intermediaries for payments to enforcement officers to clear the smuggling of liquor, cigarettes, tobacco, and other goods without declaration and the necessary inspections into the country. The syndicate is also believed to use dummy accounts for bribery transactions with complicit civil servants. Furthermore, the syndicate was discovered to be involved in money laundering by passing money through shell companies, business accounts, money changers, and licenced money lenders. ""The modus operandi is quite common. It's not peculiar... the money was also transferred directly to their accounts and it has created a pattern. It seemed like they are not worried,"" he said. Azam said a total of 231 bank accounts of individuals and companies acting as mule accounts holding RM17,621,578.50, have been frozen. He said the MACC also seized mobile phones, laptops, and eight luxury vehicles belonging to the involved syndicates to assist in their investigation. Azam said IRB and BNM would also take action through their respective laws to repatriate the losses through tax avoidance. Azam said MACC will wrap up its probe in one-and-a-half months and submit the papers to the Attorney General's Chambers for the next course of action. Previously, it was reported that the MACC had arrested and remanded 10 civil servants and five others for the same case. Before that, they arrested and remanded 11 individuals, including five public servants, to assist in investigations."

He said there was a long history of politicians using religious or racial issues for political gain in the country. ""Aren't we all sick of it? Will the PH-led Madani government tolerate this just like previous governments did? ""It is dangerous to let politicians baselessly carry on the narrative that the religion is under attack.

""It is public knowledge that a key person responsible for the build-up of tension was Umno Youth Chief, Dr Muhamad Akmal Saleh, who was relentless in playing up the issue, even after the business had made public apologies and criminal charges had been brought against them.

"Najib portrayed as 'grand chess master', ex-SRC director tells court",Dawn Chan,"March 27, 2024 @ 6:39pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Former SRC International Sdn Bhd director Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi told the High Court today that he had been misled by Datuk Seri Najib Razak and Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil on the true nature and purpose of the RM4 billion fund from the Retirement Fund Inc (KWAP) loan. Shahrol said at that material time, he trusted Najib, who is former prime minister and SRC emeritus adviser and former chief executive officer Nik Faisal, who had informed him that SRC was established to carry out strategic investment for the interests of Malaysia. Najib was SRC's emeritus adviser from May 1, 2012, until March 4, 2019. ""Bear in mind Najib was then the prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia. I was also informed that for the purpose of such projects, SRC would require a lot of funds and hence, the need to apply to KWAP for a loan. ""After the loan was approved and disbursed by KWAP, Nik Faisal informed me that SRC was inter alia working on two big coal mines investment in Indonesia and Mongolia and it was necessary to remit the KWAP loan as soon as possible in order not to miss out on good investment opportunities. ""Najib and Nik Faisal made false and misleading representations to the SRC directors, including me, regarding the true nature and purpose for the disbursements of the RM4 billion fund from KWAP loan,"" he said in his witness statement before judge Datuk Ahmad Fairuz Zainol Abidin. Shahrol was testifying as the fourth person named in the list of third-party respondents in the US$1.18 billion SRC International civil suit against Najib. Shahrol said at the material time, there was no reasonable ground for him to suspect that anything dubious or questionable was going on in SRC. ""To the best of my recollection, I remember telling Nik Faisal in respect of the disbursement of the KWAP loan that in view of the colossal sums involved, the relevant investment projects which he mentioned should be carried out as soon as possible,"" he added. He denied Najib's allegation that he was guilty of acts, omissions, wrongdoings, breaches of duties and conduct which constitute the effective and actual cause of any purported loss and damage claimed to be suffered by the SRC. ""In view of the absolute power and control exercised by Najib over the SRC, I reiterate that my duty and role as a director only exists in name and could not be exercised by me in reality,"" he said. On June 7, 2018, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said it was hunting for Nik Faisal as well as Low Taek Jho to be investigated in the SRC scandal. In 2020, police sought Interpol's help to extradite Nik Faisal who was hiding in Hong Kong with his wife and child. Meanwhile, Shahrol described Najib as having the style of a ""grand chess master"" who ""moved things around on the board"" when it came to facilitating projects for SRC as well as 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). He cited an example in relation to SRC when uranium was put into its mandate and around 2010, there was already a plan to diversify electricity sources. ""Sure enough, a separate company called the Malaysian Power Nuclear Corporation was set up around that year to kickstart the nuclear programme in Malaysia and transformed into Nuclear Energy Plan Implementation directly under the prime minister's department. ""So these were all the 'moving pieces'. And even in my experience within 1MDB, we noticed that when we are mandated to execute a project, there would be other 'chess pieces' that were also moving to complement or synergise with what we were doing,"" he answered to a question from defence counsel Muhammad Farhan Shafee. Shahrol disagreed with Farhan who had put it to him that Najib did not have a freehand in the appointment and removal of any SRC director."

Cost of mobile electric hoist – RM24,000. Cost of agency fee, immigration fee, accommodation and utilities for the maid – RM171,600. Cost of nursing care – RM4,599,000. Cost of a disabled-friendly home – RM660,000. Cost to purchase a modified MPV transport patient in a wheelchair – RM150,000. The court said the plaintiff was conscious and aware of her surroundings and will have to endure pain and suffering for the rest of her life. The girl who was born on May 12, 2020, via a Caesarean section, suffered a spinal cord injury leaving her as a tetraplegic and paralysed from neck downwards. She is currently dependent on a ventilator and has a tracheostomy attached to her. The girl, through her parents, sued the government and 18 medical officers attached to the government hospital over the incident. However, on July 26, 2022, the government admitted liability after which the plaintiff withdrew all claims against other respondents. On July 5, last year, judge Datuk Akhtar Tahir in his judgment said no amount of money could lessen the pain and suffering of the plaintiff. He said the court must give sufficient compensation to cover the plaintiff for the rest of her life. It was learnt that the hospital in its internal inquiry revealed that the medical officer who was involved in this incident had no experience to perform the surgery. The surgery was also done without supervision by any obstetrician and gynecologist."

Mohd Saibulrijal Mohd Saad, 46, was charged before Judge Azrul Darus for committing the crimes between 2020 and 2021. For 26 counts of cheating, he was accused of deceiving several bank officials by inducing them to believe that some customers intended to withdraw and buy 155 gold bars. Gold bars of various weights were purported to be withdrawn and bought using 'Gold Safe Keeping Service Withdrawal Forms' said to be signed by the customers. All the offences were committed at a bank branch in Bangsar, between 2pm and 4.30pm from July 14, 2020, to August 27, 2021. He is charged under Section 420 of the Penal Code, which carries up to 10 years in jail and whipping and can also be fined if found guilty. For 46 counts of document forgery, Saibulrijal is accused of using genuine documents at the same bank, between 9am and 4pm, between October 15, 2019, and January 13, 2021. He is charged under Section 471 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum jail term of two years or a fine or both upon conviction. The accused is also charged with misusing property, namely 33 gold bars weighing between 0.05kg and 1kg owned by three female bank customers. He was accused of committing the offence at the same bank, between August 12 and 24, 2021.

For the breach of trust offence, he was accused of misappropriating property, namely two gold bars, each weighing 500gm, belonging to a 75-year-old woman with the title Datin. The offence, under Section 406 of the Penal Code, carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail and whipping and can also be fined if found guilty. Deputy Public Prosecutor Rohaiza Zainal prosecuted, while Saibulrijal was not represented. In his plea to reduce bail, Saibulrijal told the court that he was facing another charge at a different court, and was still in remand. ""My passport has been seized and I cannot go anywhere. Please reduce the bail and allow the court to give me space to discuss with my family for the appointment of a lawyer,"" he said. Judge Azrul confirmed that the accused was granted bail of RM465,000 for the entire case along with the additional condition that the passport must be surrendered to the court before the next mention of the case on April 26 for the submission of documents and appointment of a lawyer. Last July, it was reported that Saibulrijal was acquitted of five cases involving falsifying documents and cheating in gold bullion transactions, but was recharged with 47 counts of cheating involving losses amounting to RM3.1 million, between March and June 2021."
"Court rejects Jamal Yunos' appeal, orders payment of RM300,000 to Teresa Kok for slander",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 27, 2024 @ 3:25pm","PUTRAJAYA: Sungai Besar Umno division chief Datuk Seri Jamal Md Yunos has lost his appeal to set aside the court order requiring him to pay RM300,000 to former minister Teresa Kok for defamation. Kok's counsel Datuk S. N. Nair in a statement said a three-member Court of Appeal bench led by Datuk Supang Lian today dismissed Jamal's appeal and awarded RM20,000 in cost to the respondent (Kok). Other members of the bench were Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Wong Kian Kheong. ""We also managed to move the court for a consequential order that the money held by stakeholders be released to the respondent immediately,"" he said. Jamal was represented by Rejinder Singh while counsels Jaden Phoon Wai Ken and Rebecca Marshall appeared for the respondent. On March 29, last year, the appellate court granted Jamal a conditional stay of an order requiring that he pay RM300,000 in damages to Kok. However, the judges ordered Jamal to deposit the RM300,000 judgment sum into Kok's solicitors' account. On July 26, 2022, High Court judge Datuk Mohd Arief Emran Arifin, who was a judicial commissioner at the time, granted Kok a general aggravated and exemplary sum of RM300,000, and RM50,000 in costs with five per cent interest after winning a defamation suit filed against Jamal. In his judgment, Mohd Arief said the court had taken into account the arguments of both parties, and that Jamal, who represented himself in the suit, had failed to defend himself. The former primary industries minister filed the suit on April 6, 2017, over Jamal's alleged defamatory statement pertaining to the misuse of Yayasan Warisan Anak Selangor (Yawas) funds during a press conference on March 8, 2017. In her statement of claim, Kok said that Jamal had alleged at the press conference that she had embezzled money from the Selangor state fund. Videos of the press conference were then published on Jamal's Facebook and YouTube pages, which had garnered 2,800 and 1,800 views, respectively. Kok, who is also Seputeh MP, claimed that the defamatory statement, among others, gave the impression that she had misused state government funds for her own use and was an unethical person. She had sought RM1 million in general damages, along with compensatory, aggravated and exemplary damages, and an injunction to prevent Jamal from repeating or spreading the allegations."
Man with 22 investigation papers continues to stir up 3R issues [NSTTV],Aliza Shah,"March 27, 2024 @ 3:24pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A man who has more than 20 investigation papers opened over him has once again stirred up controversy with his video containing crude content that touches on 3R (race, religion, and royalty) issues. Federal Police Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said the man, Ganesparan Nadaraja, is not a foreign character; in fact, he has been producing controversial videos and has been on the police wanted list since 2018. ""From 2018 until yesterday, we have initiated 22 investigation papers. ""Our investigation since 2018 found that he has left the country and has yet to return. So we believe that the video that went viral yesterday was produced overseas,"" he said in a press conference. Mohd Shuhaily said the police investigation found that Ganesparan, whose passport was revoked in 2020, is currently residing in a European country. It is unknown whether he has been granted permanent residency in the country where he currently resides. Ganesparan, he said, had been charged in absentia in 2021 for insulting the then Yang Dipertuan Agong and Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob. ""For the two (new) reports that we received for his latest videos that went viral, they will be investigated and similar action will be taken (charged in absentia). ""We have yet to complete the investigation, we will take a few statements, obtain profiling from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, and refine the investigation papers before bringing them to the Attorney-General's Chambers for further action,"" he said. Mohd Shuhaily said the first investigation paper was under Section 29A and Section 504 of the Penal Code, and Section 233 of the MCMC Act. For the second video, the investigation paper falls under Section 4(1) of the Sedition Act, Section 29A, Section 505c, and Section 504 of the Penal Code, as well as Section 233 of the MCMC Act. Mohd Shuhaily said the police had previously sought Interpol's assistance to issue a Red Notice alert on him. However, the request was turned down, citing Article 3 of the Interpol Constitution rules, which stipulate that issues related to religion and ethnicity cannot be considered as offences eligible for a Red Notice alert. The videos in question show Ganesparan insulting Islam, the Sultan of Selangor, and making various accusations against the police. It is understood that one of the videos was uploaded on March 23. However, checks indicate that his Facebook page is no longer accessible."

"2 lawyers, client in contempt of court for filing false evidence",Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 27, 2024 @ 2:41pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Two lawyers and their client, who were found guilty of contempt by the Court of Appeal for filing false evidence, will receive their sentence next month. Sessions Court judge Halilah Suboh fixed April 2 for sentencing. The case involves lawyers Mark Robin Tallala and G. Mahadeva, as well as their client Jagmohan Singh Sandhu. In October last year, a three-member bench led by Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera found the trio guilty of filing a false witness statement for Allen David Martinez without approval at the Sessions Court four years ago. Other members of the bench were Datuk Seri Mariana Yahya and Datuk Azimah Omar. Then, the court said they disagreed with the lower court's finding that the filing of the impugned witness statement was merely a ""mistake"". ""The impugned document was knowingly filed notwithstanding the full knowledge that the solicitors have not communicated, consulted, nor have met Martinez,"" the court said in its judgment. ""The solicitors knew they had not obtained proper confirmation from the intended witness and yet they found it acceptable to ignore the absence of personal confirmation. ""Instead, the solicitors felt it was appropriate to just rely on the instructions and confirmation of their client."" The false evidence came to light after Martinez filed an affidavit in 2020 denying every answer in the impugned witness statement. He also said he did not communicate nor meet the lawyers before the filing of the impugned document. Tallala and Mahadeva later admitted to having never met or sought Martinez personal confirmation before the filing of the impugned witness statement. They blamed Jagmohan and said they relied solely on their client's instruction and the supposition that the latter had finalised the contents of the impugned witness statement with Martinez. The court said lawyers cannot entrust their client with the responsibility of obtaining confirmation from witnesses. It said this showed the lawyer's conduct went beyond a ""mistake"" and encroached on the realm of inconsiderate presumptions and dishonesty. ""It is not the contents nor the veracity of the contents of the impugned document that irritates and offended the face of the Court, but it was the callous conduct of the solicitors in filing the impugned witness statement that accords contempt of court."" The court said even though the impugned witness statement would not be admissible as evidence as it was unsigned, it still did not erase the solicitors' contemptuous conduct of improperly filing the document. ""There has never been a rule or precedent that contempt follows the event or outcome of the main litigation nor should there ever be such a rule of law. ""Contempt remains contempt no matter how meritorious the case of the contemnor (or contemnor's client) would be.   ""Whether the witness statement was later signed and admitted before the court is distinctly a separate matter."" The court said lawyers should not put their own words or narratives into the mouth of a witness, and that this was a ""basic rule of law and ethics"". The court has ordered the case to be remitted back to the Sessions Court for contempt proceedings to proceed. In today's proceedings at the Sessions Court, lawyer Datuk Harpal Singh Grewal who appeared for Tallala and Mahadeva said any custodial sentence against his clients would have very serious consequences for their future. ""This is an extensive mistake for the solicitors to learn. Tallala comes from a very respectable family and has been in practice for 21 years, while Mahadeva was just assisting his senior and was not very instrumental in filing the affidavit. ""This is the first time in my career that I have come across a case where an unsigned witness statement can be the subject of contempt. ""The impugned witness statement was never utilised by both parties and the defendant in the trial was not prejudiced by the unsigned witness statement,"" he said in his mitigation. Jagmohan's lawyer Ratni Jebaratham said her client was just a layman who did not understand the court's procedure for filing evidence. ""Even though my client has a law degree, he never practices and only provides consultation services,"" she said. However, Bhavanash Sharma, the petitioner in the case, argued for a deterrent sentence, citing the contemnors' dishonesty and deceitfulness towards the court. ""They have never issued an apology and fought this case until the Court of Appeal. This is not just a mistake; it is fraud in the court,"" said Bhavanash, who was assisted by Chetna Brijmohan ""A custodial sentence must be imposed so that it will not be a mockery of the appellate court's decision,"" he said."

""We don't want to see another Kampung Medan or any other racial incidences in this country because that will only worsen the state of the country and tarnish its image."" Shuhaily said those involved in the KK Mart controversy have been charged yesterday, and the public should let the justice system work. """"Let (them) go through the existing justice system. ""How we handle sensitive issues in this country will show the maturity of our people . ""We used to have preventive laws (Internal Security Act), and that was repealed because it reflects the maturity of society in discussing such sensitive matters. So today, we are tested on our maturity in handling such issues,"" he said, adding the police, with whatever power they have, will investigate all 3R cases. Yesterday five people were charged in relation to the KK Mart stockings controversy. Among them were KK Mart Group founder and executive chairman Datuk Chai Kee Kan and his wife Datin Loh Siew Mui, who both pleaded not guilty at the Shah Alam Sessions Court here with intentionally wounding the religious feelings of Muslims by displaying socks bearing the word ""Allah"" at its Bandar Sunway outlet.

"Top court rules JF Apex Securities, Mercury Securities merger lawful, did not oppress Concrete Parade",Dawn Chan,"March 26, 2024 @ 7:53pm","KUALA LUMPUR: The Federal Court denied the challenge by Concrete Parade Sdn Bhd, a dissenting minority shareholder of Apex Equity Holding Bhd, after ruling that a 2018 proposed merger between JF Apex Securities Bhd and Mercury Securities Sdn Bhd was lawful and did not oppress them. A three-member apex court bench led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat set aside the decision by the Court of Appeal and reinstated the decision by the High Court. The two other members of the bench were Federal Court judges Tan Sri Nallini Pathmanathan and Datuk Rhozariah Bujang. Concrete Parade had, among its seven questions of law, sought a declaration that the heads of agreement signed between Apex and Mercury on Sept 21, 2018 and a business merger agreement signed between JF Apex and Mercury Securities on Dec 28, 2018 were illegal, unlawful and void due to oppression of minority shareholders rights. To a question on whether the use of the oppression provision was the proper way to remedy Concrete Parade's grievances, the bench answered in the negative. ""The Court of Appeal erred in concluding that the merger would 'unfairly prejudice' Concrete Parade as a shareholder because the value of its investments in Apex Equity would diminish. ""It failed to comprehend that the shareholders at a general meeting had voted in favour of the merger. If the majority approved the merger, how then was Concrete Parade unfairly prejudiced? All shareholders would have suffered the same fate. ""More importantly, it is majority rule that prevails. The fundamental principle of governance in companies is the majority rule.

""Secondly, and more importantly, Concrete Parade has failed to establish how the fact of the share buyback transactions being ultra vires the constitution unfairly prejudices it as a minority shareholder.

It said the Court of Appeal also erred when concluding that such ultra vires transactions, which involved the entirety of the shareholders of Apex Equity, resulted in unfairly prejudicial conduct against Concrete Parade as a minority shareholder.

Jana Wibawa scandal: Contractor involved rated 4 stars by CIDB,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 26, 2024 @ 6:44pm","KUALA LUMPUR: Nepturis Sdn Bhd, the company implicated in the corruption trial involving the Jana Wibawa scandal, received a four-star rating from the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). CIDB assistant engineer Siti Nooraishah Zainal Abidin said a letter on behalf of Nepturis was issued from the board's construction industry information management system (CIMS) after the company applied for the contractor capability and performance assessment programme (SCORE). ""CIMS will generate a reference number for the SCORE application process. ""It was found that Nepturis had obtained a four-star rating based on re-examination of documents uploaded by the company. ""I can confirm that I have seen the CIDB SCORE letter on behalf of Nepturis dated Oct 26, 2021,"" she said. Nooraishah said this when testifying in the corruption and money laundering trial involving Tasek Gelugor member of parliament Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan involving the Jana Wibawa scandal. Nepturis is a company allegedly assisted by Wan Saiful in obtaining the Central Spine Road: Sertik ke Persimpangan Lebuhraya Pantai Timur project from the government through a pre-qualification process worth RM232 million. Deputy public prosecutor Siti Amirah Muhammad Ali during examination-in-chief asked the witness about the necessity for a company to obtain a star rating from CIDB. Nooraishah said the rating would provide recognition to contractors with capabilities and capacities, which would assist clients in selecting reputable contractors for their respective projects. The witness said in SCORE, CIDB would assess based on documents uploaded by contractors or companies including business performance, financial and technical capability as well as project management. She said besides assessing the capabilities of a company, CIDB would also check the status of a contractor company, whether it was Bumiputera-status or vice versa. ""However, I am not sure about the status of Nepturis because it is not within my job scope. I only manage the accreditation unit,"" she added. Wan Saiful, 47, is charged with soliciting a bribe from one Lian Tan Chuan as an inducement for him to help a company, Nepturis Sdn Bhd, secure the RM232 million-worth ""Central Spine Road: Sertik to East Coast Expressway Interchange"" project from the federal government. Wan Saiful is charged with receiving RM6,962,694.54, which was transferred from a Maybank Islamic Bhd account owned by Nepturis Sdn Bhd into a CIMB Bank Bhd account held by his company, WSA Advisory Group Sdn Bhd, as a reward for helping the company obtain a letter of acceptance for the project. He is alleged to have committed both offences at the Royal Lake Club, Taman Tasik Perdana here, in April last year and at CIMB Bank Bhd Bukit Tunku branch, Taman Tunku, Bukit Tunku here, between July 8 and Sept 30 last year. Wan Saiful was also charged with 18 counts of money laundering involving RM5.59 million by transferring and using the illegal proceeds to pay for the purchase of a Ford Ranger vehicle, making payments to the Malaysian National Sports Council as well as transferring money to several company accounts, including one belonging to Sinar Karangkraf Sdn Bhd."

Rosmah fails in final bid to challenge Sri Ram as lead prosecutor,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 26, 2024 @ 1:35pm","PUTRAJAYA: Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor failed in her final bid to challenge the appointment of the late Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram as lead prosecutor in her RM1.25 billion solar hybrid project in Sarawak graft case. A three-member Federal Court bench chaired by Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim today unanimously dismissed Rosmah's leave application for her appeal to be heard at the apex court. Other members of the bench were Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil. The court ruled that there were no new legal issues that warrant additional discussion before the top court. Rosmah, who is the wife of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, is seeking leave from the apex court to hear her appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision which dismissed her bid on grounds that her appeal has no merit. On June 22, last year, the appellate court said the relief sought by the applicant (Rosmah) remained a live issue since it concerns the alleged irregularity, illegality and defectiveness of the government's letter of appointment, or fiat, issued to Sri Ram. Sri Ram died on Jan 28, at the age of 79, in a private hospital here following a lung infection. Rosmah, 73, filed the application for leave to initiate a judicial review in the High Court last year, naming the attorney-general/ public prosecutor, the government and Sri Ram as respondents. She sought a declaration that Sri Ram's appointment as senior deputy public prosecutor (DPP) through three fiats dated July 8, 2020, May 11 and May 21, 2021 was unlawful. She also wanted a declaration that the entire prosecution proceedings and full trial for her case, which took place beginning Nov 15, 2018, right up to the time the defence closed the case, were invalid and void and that she must be acquitted of all charges under Section 16(a)(A) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act 2009. On Aug 30, 2022, the High Court refused to give leave to allow her to commence a judicial review to challenge Sri Ram's appointment as lead prosecutor in her case. Prior to applying for the judicial review, Rosmah had applied to disqualify Sri Ram but it was dismissed by judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, who had presided over her solar hybrid corruption trial. Her appeals to the Court of Appeal and Federal Court were also dismissed. High Court judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid had dismissed Rosmah's application for leave to initiate a judicial review two days before Zaini was scheduled to deliver his verdict in her graft case. On Sept 1, 2022, Zaini found Rosmah guilty of the corruption charges and sentenced her to 10 years in jail and a fine of RM970 million. Rosmah was charged with soliciting RM187.5 million and two counts of accepting bribes amounting to RM6.5 million from Jepak Holdings Sdn Bhd managing director Saidi Abang Samsudin through her former aide Datuk Rizal Mansor. This was done as a reward for helping Jepak Holdings secure a RM1.25 billion project to provide solar hybrid energy in 369 schools in rural Sarawak. She has filed an appeal against her conviction and sentence. Her appeal is pending in the Court of Appeal. Rosmah has been released on RM2 million bail pending her appeal.  "

"SRC ex-CEO Nik Faisal took charge of finances, KWAP loans, witness tells court",Dawn Chan,"March 25, 2024 @ 4:28pm","KUALA LUMPUR: A former SRC International Sdn Bhd director told the High Court today that former chief executive officer Nik Faisal Ariff Kamil was responsible for the finances of the company, specifically the RM4 billion Retirement Fund Inc. loans. Datuk Mohammed Azhar Osman Khairuddin was testifying as the third person named in the list of third-party respondents in the US$1.18 billion SRC International civil suit against former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. In his witness statement, Azhar, 69, who was also CEO, said he was appointed as SRC director on July 29, 2014 and resigned on Feb 22, 2017. ""When I came in, I took over from Nik Faisal as CEO of the Sabah Gas Pipeline Project and the Peninsular Pipeline Project. ""But Nik Faisal remained as an executive director of SRC in charge of handling all the finances, specifically the KWAP loans,"" he testified before judge Datuk Ahmad Fairuz Zainol Abidin. To a question on whether he was in charge of anything related to SRC finances or loans, Azhar said,""No, that was Nik Faisal's role and responsibility."" On June 7, 2018, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said it was hunting for Nik Faisal as well as Low Taek Jho to be investigated in the SRC scandal. In 2020, police sought Interpol's help to extradite Nik Faisal who was hiding in Hong Kong with his wife and child. Meanwhile, Azhar said the two RM4 billion KWAP loans to SRC in 2011 and 2022 were granted to SRC before his appointment as director. Azhar said he did not cause financial losses or breach his statutory and fiduciary duties as alleged by Najib. ""I cannot be in breach of duties for matters that had happened before I joined the company in 2014. ""My specific task when joining SRC was to execute and get going the projects which were two out of the three identified oil and gas projects in my role as CEO,"" he said. He said this in his reply to Najib's allegations that he, along with other former SRC directors, had breached their statutory duties. Azhar also dismissed Najib's allegations that Articles 74,75, and 78 of SRC International Memorandum of Articles; as well as Section 131B of the Companies Act 1975 gave the board exclusive powers to manage SRC. ""I categorically deny this. As far as I can tell from my time there as a director, whenever it came to finances, Nik Faisal would always begin by briefing the board of directors on the finances of SRC. ""Myself and other members of the board would direct Nik Faisal and management to come up with a plan to retrieve the monies back. ""That was all I could do given that the KWAP loans were disbursed out of SRC before my tenure as a director. ""I was also never a signatory nor ever in a position to give instructions to the accounts deposited overseas, whether in Switzerland or elsewhere,"" he said. Azhar also shot down another allegation by Najib that all losses claimed by SRC, as a result of the transactions making up the proposed investment fund and the purported fund investment, were the result of various acts and omissions of the former SRC directors. On May 7, 2021, SRC's new management initiated legal action against Najib, naming him as the first defendant, for alleged breach of trust and breach of statutory duty involving the RM4 billion KWAP loans to SRC. The trial continues tomorrow."

Man sentenced to 30 years in jail for murdering friend over microphone,Rahmat Khairulrijal,"March 25, 2024 @ 9:34am","KUALA LUMPUR: An altercation over a microphone led to a 35-year-old Myanmar national being sentenced to 30 years in jail and 12 lashes of the rotan after the High Court in Johor Baru found him guilty of murdering his fellow countryman five years ago. The incident occurred when the accused, Aung Zaw Win, had a problem with his microphone during his karaoke session and asked to borrow a new microphone from deceased, Myat Zaw Lwin, who is also his housemate. However, Myat refused to lend his microphone, but Aung still insisted, resulting in a heated argument between the two. During the fight, the accused grabbed a knife from the kitchen and started stabbing the deceased after the latter had thrown an iron table, which hit the former on the forehead. In the trial, pathologist Dr. Rohayu Shahar Adnan testified that the deceased succumbed to 12 cuts on his body including four fatal stab wounds on the left side of his torso, which perforated vital organs and severed blood vessels. The prosecution submitted that the accused admitted he had a short temper and had shown intent to harm someone during a fight. However, during mitigation the accused pleaded that he regreted his action and asked for the court to give him a second chance. Judicial Commissioner Noor Hayati Mat in her judgment said pursuant to the recent amendment of Section 302 of the Penal Code and the abolition of the mandatory death penalty act 2023, the court has been given a discretion to consider alternative punishments other than death penalty. ""In this case, I have considered the individual circumstances, such as the deceased being the accused's housemate, a colleague, and a friend. ""The accused held the deceased after the stabbing, indicating remorse and fear. ""Remorse after awakening from his criminal act is a valid consideration in giving the accused a second chance at life,"" she said in her grounds of judgment published on the judiciary website yesterday. She said the case was not premeditated or aggravated murder as the accused was in a state of uncontrolled rage during the incident. ""Although it is a serious offence, it is not a heinous act of violence, which would justify a death sentence. ""I am of the opinion that it was a spontaneous assault (sufficient to cause death according to the ordinary course of nature) and not a preplanned act. ""Again, that does not mean it is not serious, but the length of the sentence passed is not short, but 30 years of his freedom will be taken away just because he could not control his anger fighting over a microphone,"" she added."

Sarawak drug dealers using empty LPG cylinders to conceal shipments to Kalimantan,Bruno J,"March 19, 2024 @ 3:41pm","KUCHING: Sarawak police have uncovered the use of LPG cylinders by drug traffickers to conceal shipments to West Kalimantan. They stumbled on this when police busted a drug pipeline from the peninsula to the Indonesian province of West Kalimantan. Investigations revealed that the traffickers stuffed empty 14kg liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders with the drugs before they transported it across the border via illegal border crossings. Narcotics Crime Investigation Department Director, Commissioner of Police Datuk Khaw Kok Chin, revealed this modus operandi by the drug dealers at a press conference here following a drug seizure in Miri. The drugs seized amounted to a street value of RM716,000. Khaw said drug couriers, who were paid RM3,000 each, would cut the bottom of the cylinders and then stuff the packed drugs – methamphetamine, or syabu as its more popularly known, into the cylinders. Each cylinder could hold up to 10 packages of drugs. LPG cylinders are unlikely to raise suspicions as they are a common item that Indonesian villagers living along the length of the Sarawak-Kalimantan border carry across daily. ""The backpacks or bags – the usual places where drugs and other contraband are normally carried – would be more likely searched than a gas cylinder,"" Khaw said. Investigations showed the drug traffickers took a circuitous route that originated from the peninsula. The drugs were flown by air on a regular airline to the northern Sarawak town of Miri. Khaw said from there, the drugs were taken south on the Pan Borneo Highway to the unauthorised border crossing at Batu Lintang, in the Sri Aman Division, some 634km away. He said before the drugs were transported to Batu Lintang, they were picked up from the airport and sent to a house in Lutong, a township some 20km from Miri town. There, the drugs were repacked into Chinese tea packages before it was transported to the border. Khaw said Sarawak was only used as a transit point and Kalimantan was the final destination as the ""demand on the other side was much higher."" He said if in Malaysia, the street value of 1kg of syabu was RM3,000, in Kalimantan, the value could triple or even go up to five times when supply was low. Khaw said the raid on the Lutong house was on intelligence police had gathered. In the raid, police initially arrested two people who were in a car parked in front of the property. He said one of the suspects was a man linked to a drug syndicate. Khaw said the suspect was paid RM20,000 to recruit couriers to repack and transport the drugs to the border. In the raid on the house, four more suspects were detained. ""We found the drugs inside the house,"" Khaw said. He said the drugs weighed 21,700g. He added that it was enough to feed the cravings of 108, 500 addicts. Also seized in the raid were cash totalling RM52,000, jewellery worth RM54,000 and four cars suspected to be used in transporting the drugs. The six suspects arrested - four males, two females whose ages ranged from 28 to 60 – face charges under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drug Act, 1953 which carries the mandatory death penalty on conviction. Khaw said of the six who underwent the urine test for drug use, only one returned positive. The suspect also had a previous conviction for being involved in cockfighting."

MACC believes Mohammad Zyed Ibrahim, whose last known address is Mesahill Apartment, Persiaran Ilmu BBN, Bandar Baru Nilai, can help shed light on the activities of the syndicate which smuggled tobacco, cigarettes and alcohol, among others, into the country. Those with information on Zyed's whereabouts should contact investigating officer Mohammad Riduwan Mohammad Radzi at 016-4603096 or email him at mriduwan@sprm.gov.my.

""The case is being investigated under Section 298 of the Penal Code and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998,"" he said. Meanwhile, members of the public who know the identity of the man were seen attempting to locate the suspect at his residence, presumably to inquire about the reasons behind his hurtful comments towards Muslims. A viral video on social media showed a group of individuals waiting for the suspect outside the entrance to the lobby of a condominium, which serves as the suspect's residence in this city. However, access to the lobby entrance was guarded by security personnel, and the group dispersed upon seeing the suspect entering the elevator. The video also captured voices of people expressing their inability to accept the suspect's actions even after he had apologised. Through another post on social media, the suspect uploaded an apology to the Muslim community for all his comments and what he had written. He also confessed to being a recent convert to Islam, having embraced the religion just two years ago, and acknowledged the need for further learning about matters related to the faith. Meanwhile, the people of Sabah were reminded not to engage in any form of insult towards any religion or belief practiced by the community in this country. Assistant Minister to the Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Nizam Abu Bakar Titingan said any issues related to the 3Rs, namely religion, race, and royal institution, should be completely avoided in order to preserve unity. He said that if issues related to the 3Rs arise, they not only tarnish the principle of unity but also subject the perpetrators to legal action.
