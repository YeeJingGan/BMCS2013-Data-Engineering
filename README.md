# BMCS2013-Data-Engineering

**Course Objective**  
This course covers Big Data solutions like Hadoop, MapReduce, Apache Hive, and Spark, along with foundational concepts of distributed computing, data processing, and management. Students will learn to run data workflows on common platforms and apply descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics for fact-based decision-making.

**Project Focus**
Title: Topic Classification of Crime News Articles


This project involves scraping crime news articles from various news platforms, preprocessing the text using NLP techniques, and developing a Random Forest model to classify articles into categories such as drug offenses, murder and homicide, scams, physical assault, robbery or theft, money laundering, firearms or terrorism, sexual offenses (including harassment and rape), or others. Feature engineering and ablation were applied to enhance model performance. Finally, the model was deployed using Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming.
