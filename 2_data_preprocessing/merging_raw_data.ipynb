Judge Azrol Abdullah meted the sentence on Low Yu Ning, 38, after she pleaded guilty to exposing the child in a manner likely to lead to her death at a house on Jalan Danau Kota, Off Jalan Genting Kelang, at 1pm on December 6, 2021. She was charged under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, which carries a maximum penalty of a RM50,000 fine or up to 20 years in prison, or both. The court also ordered Low to be placed on a one-year good behaviour bond with a surety of RM2,000. According to the case facts, a Malaysian Emergency Response Services 999 (MERS 999) operator received a report of the girl’s death and subsequently filed a police report. Police arrested the accused at the house in Danau Kota and discovered that she had left the child unsupervised in a car seat in a room. Considering that the accused was the person responsible for the child, the act of placing her in a car seat without supervision created a situation that could have resulted in the child’s death. Today’s proceedings were conducted by deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Muhairi Mohamed Noh. Meanwhile, Low’s lawyer S. Kirthen, confirmed after the proceedings that they had submitted a representation to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) to drop the charges against his client. “Initially, my client was charged with abuse, but the AGC amended the charge as there were no signs of beating recorded in the medical report,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

The courts ordered both prison sentences against the Malaysian Automotive, Robotics, and IoT Institute (MARii) former CEO Datuk Mohamad Madani Sahari to run concurrently from today. In the first instance, Judge Rozina Ayob sentenced Madani, 57, to one year in prison and fined him RM100,000 after he pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of deceiving MARii’s board of directors (BOD) into believing that LPS Learning Platform’s contract price was RM6.4 million when it was actually RM2.3 million. His actions led the board to award the company an RM6.4 million contract, appointing it as a training provider for the Central, East Coast, Southern, Sabah, and Sarawak regions. Rozina also ordered the accused to serve an additional three-month prison term if the accused failed to settle the fine. The offences were committed at a hotel along Jalan Stesen Sentral Dua on December 14, 2019. Madani was charged under Section 420 of the Penal Code, which carries between one and ten years of imprisonment, with a fine and caning upon conviction. Then, Judge Suzana Hussin sentenced him to one year in prison and ordered the confiscation of his assets worth RM3.4 million after he pleaded guilty to another alternative charge of receiving RM5 million in cash for himself from a 49-year-old man at a bank in Section 15, Shah Alam, on July 8, 2021. The accused was charged under Section 165 of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum imprisonment of two years or a fine, or both upon conviction. However, the 41 initial main charges under Section 403 and Section 420 of the Penal Code, Section 16(a)(A) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act, and Section 4 of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing, and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLATFPUAA) against Madani were taken into consideration under Section 171A of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Bukit Aman NCID director Datuk Khaw Kok Chin said that in the 10pm operation, the man and his wife, both aged 41, were arrested at a condominium unit along Jalan Cheras, Batu 5. “Upon searching the unit, police found 44.93kg of cocaine and 52.5 litres of chemicals kept in bottles. “Preliminary investigations found that the man acted as a runner while his wife managed the supply and processed the drugs,” he said during a press conference at the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters today. Preliminary investigations also found the couple had rented the unit, which is believed to have been used as a store and cocaine processing laboratory, since February for RM2,350 a month. Following their arrest, Khaw said police then detained a 38-year-old man, also acting as a runner for the syndicate, at an apartment in Taman Kasturi, Cheras, and seized 1kg of chemical powder from the unit. He added that preliminary investigations found the syndicate, which has been active since early this year, had used the premises as a place to process and store cocaine before being distributed to overseas markets via air transport. One of the suspects tested positive for ketamine and had eight prior records involving criminal and drug offences. “The man and his wife have been remanded for seven days until Tuesday (July 23), while the other man has been remanded for four days until Saturday (July 20),” Khaw said.

       "   'cf1:content': 'JOHOR BAHRU, July 17 — A former security guard escaped the death penalty after the Federal Court replaced it with a 40-year prison sentence for murdering his friend’s teenage daughter 13 years ago. A three-judge panel, led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, handed down the prison sentence to D. Kalaiselvan, 59, after allowing his application to review the death sentence. Judge Tengku Maimun, along with Federal Court Judge Datuk Nordin Hassan and Court of Appeal Judge Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, ordered the prison sentence to start on July 3, 2011, the date of arrest. Kalaiselvan was found guilty of murdering Nur Rahayu Qomarudin, 16, at the Sungai Masai oil palm plantation between 2.30am and 2.50am on June 18, 2011. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi requested the court to uphold the death penalty as the victim, who was still a child at the time, was brutally murdered, having been beaten, stabbed in the neck, and burned. However, lawyer Datin Kharen Jit Kaur, representing Kalaiselvan, requested that the review application be allowed. Kalaiselvan was sentenced to death by the Johor Bahru High Court on December 26, 2012, and his appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal on March 18, 2014. The Federal Court sitting in Putrajaya on August 25, 2015, also upheld his death sentence. Meanwhile, the same court also set aside the death penalty against Habin Noor Sulaiman, 56, who was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Nur Ain Ashikin Jemedi, 17, in 2010 by stabbing her 19 times and pouring formic acid on her head. She died in the hospital 21 days later. The court replaced the death penalty with a 38-year prison sentence starting from the date of arrest on December 16, 2010. Tetralina requested the court to maintain the death sentence as the victim was pregnant at the time of the incident, which meant Habin Noor took two lives. Lawyer Muhammad Abd Kadir said his client had admitted to the act and surrendered himself to the Ulu Tiram police station after the victim’s family reported the incident. On January 3, 2011, Habin was sentenced to 17 years in prison by the Kota Tinggi Sessions Court after pleading guilty to attempted murder by using a knife, in addition to another 17-year prison sentence for splashing formic acid, seriously injuring the victim. Both offences were committed in Jalan Cemara 2, Kampung Baru Sungai Redan, Kota Tinggi, at 9.15am on December 16, 2010. In 2014, the Court of Appeal amended the charge against Habin Noor to Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder, resulting in the death penalty, which was upheld by the Federal Court on March 22, 2016. Meanwhile, former police corporal Muhammad Faizal Salim, 47, also escaped the death penalty and was sentenced to 40 years in prison with 12 lashes for murdering his pregnant girlfriend Norzielawati Akmar Afandi, 35. The court ordered Faizal to serve his sentence starting from the date of arrest on April 13, 2015. He was charged with murdering the woman at Hutan Bandar Bukit Cantik, Mersing, between 11pm on April 12, 2015, and 12.30am on April 13, 2015. Tetralina requested that the death penalty be upheld as the autopsy report revealed that the cause of Norzielawati’s death was a severe blow with a blunt object to the head, and the deceased also had 47 other injuries on her body, such as bruises, cuts and abrasions. “The baby in her womb was also six months old, so the applicant had killed two lives, and witnesses also heard the victim pleading not to be beaten, but the applicant ignored her,” she said. Faizal’s lawyer Iskandar Shah Ibrahim said his client had intended to take the victim for medical treatment. On May 21, 2018, the Court of Appeal upheld Faizal’s conviction and death sentence, and the Federal Court also maintained this decision. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'JOHOR BAHRU, July 16 — The Federal Court has upheld the death sentence imposed on a man who murdered his six-year-old stepson 13 years ago. A three-judge panel, led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, made the unanimous decision to reject the application by Azman Abd Rahman, 49, for a review to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment in accordance with the Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. She accepted the prosecution’s objection to Azman’s review application to set aside the death sentence against him. “The application from the accused (Azman) is hereby rejected, and the existing sentence is upheld,” said Tengku Maimun, who sat with Federal Court judges Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Hanipah Farikullah. Earlier, the Attorney General’s Chambers’ Trials and Appeals Division head Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar objected to Azman’s review application, and requested the court uphold the death sentence. The accused is represented by lawyer S. Vijay Ratnam, “The autopsy discovered more than 72 injuries on the victim’s body, particularly in the muscles, lungs, head, and abdomen, resulting from strong blows with a blunt object. “According to the witness, an employee of the accused, he attempted to stop Azman from beating the six-year-old victim, but was scolded and told to stay out his family affairs,” said Dusuki. Meanwhile, Vijay Ratnam requested the court to set aside the death sentence and allow a review, arguing that his client deeply regrets his actions and is now suffering from several diseases, including antisocial personality disorder, hypertension, and chronic Hepatitis C. On June 5, 2015, the High Court in Melaka sentenced Azman to death after finding him guilty of murdering Muhammad Firdaus Mohd Dan, aged six, at an oil palm plantation in Kampung Solok Pinang Gadek, Alor Gajah, Melaka, between 10.30am and 2.15pm on October 10, 2011. His appeal was rejected by the Putrajaya Court of Appeal on September 7, 2016, and the Federal Court subsequently upheld the conviction and sentence on October 5, 2017. According to the case facts, on the day of the incident, as they were heading to the applicant’s workplace, the victim told the accused that he needed to urinate or defecate, only to be slapped hard on the cheek. Upon arriving at the location, Azman scolded the victim, kicked the child in the ribs and beat him repeatedly with a tree branch until the child collapsed. He then took the child to the Alor Gajah Hospital, where Firdaus was pronounced dead. — Bernama ',\n",

The panel, which included judges Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Mohamed Zaini Mazlan, dismissed the accused’s appeal against his conviction but granted his appeal for a sentence reduction. Justice Che Mohd Ruzima said the man failed to adduce any errors in the Sessions Court’s findings, and the High Court had also affirmed the lower court’s decision. In 2022, the former driver was found guilty by the Sessions Court on five counts of sexually assaulting his daughters, 12, 10, and five, in a house in Taman Kledang, Perak, on June 4, 2019, May 4, 2019, and May 7, 2019, respectively. He faced two counts of sexually assaulting his 12-year-old, two counts of similar offences against his 10-year-old, and one count of sexually assaulting his five-year-old. The accused was sentenced to a total of 34 years in prison with 10 strokes of the cane for all the offences, and in March last year, the High Court affirmed both his conviction and sentence. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with two strokes of the cane for each count involving his older daughters and 10 years imprisonment with two strokes of the cane for the offence against his five-year-old daughter. Today, the Court of Appeal reduced the initial eight-year jail term to six years and lowered the 10-year imprisonment to eight while upholding the caning.

According to the charges, Saiful, the owner of PMBIS Growth Venture, transferred RM926,427.53 in proceeds from unlawful activities to accounts belonging to four individuals through four transactions. All the offences were allegedly committed at CIMB Islamic Bank Berhad, Centro Mall Branch, Klang, Selangor, on July 27 last year. The charges were framed under Section 4(1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001, which provides imprisonment for up to 15 years and can also be fined not less than five times the amount or value of the proceeds from the unlawful activity or RM5 million, whichever is higher if convicted. Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurul Wahida Jalaluddin offered bail at RM30,000 for each charge, as the offences were serious and of public concern. Lawyer Pang Tek Kit, representing the accused, requested a lower bail, stating that his client is struggling to find a job due to the case and has three children aged one to 11 to care for. The court then set bail at RM15,000 with one surety with one surety for each charge and ordered Saiful Nizam to report to the nearest police station on the first day of each month.

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said the states include Perak, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, Terengganu, and Labuan. The raids led to the arrests of 11 individuals aged between 38 and 56, including the organisation’s founders, directors, and volunteers. “Initial investigations revealed that the scam syndicate, operating under the guise of Pertubuhan Amal Kita Kinta, Perak, had been active since early last year, promising returns of either one kampung chicken or RM13 per month for every RM250 invested. “Investors deposited funds into the organisation’s bank account. However, from September 2023 onwards, they stopped receiving the promised returns. “A total of 85 police reports on the case were received nationwide,” he said at a press conference today. The police seized 13 luxury vehicles, 13 gold chains, two gold rings, 20 smartphones, 17 laptops, eight chequebooks, 37 bank cards, 2,143 sheep, and numerous documents suspected to be related to the scam. They also froze the organisation’s 34 bank and unit trust accounts, totalling RM6.5 million, under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing, and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001. Ramli said the case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. On a separate note, he advised the public to exercise caution when making donations, especially if it involved unregistered individuals or organisations. The public’s tendency to sympathise and offer help to individuals facing adversity creates opportunities for unscrupulous individuals to exploit these sentiments for financial gain under the guise of charity. “The public must ensure that their donations are made only to registered organisations that undergo audit processes. They also need to know how the donations are used. “Bank accounts of organisations collecting donations must also undergo audits to ensure that the funds received are directed to the intended parties,” Ramli emphasised. He was commenting on the recent arrests related to the misappropriation of donations. Yesterday, a social media influencer couple was remanded for four days to assist in an investigation into the alleged misappropriation of donations. A source from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission disclosed that the couple has been suspected of misappropriating public donations, estimated at RM3 million, since 2020. In another instance, the police arrested a man on July 9 at his residence in Wangsa Maju for allegedly being involved in a fraud case related to the collection of donations since last year, resulting in losses exceeding RM140,000. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-judge panel comprising Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, Federal Court judges Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, allowed V. Raja’s review application under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. Justice Tengku Maimun ordered the prison sentence on Raja to begin from the date of his arrest on May 23, 2010, and also imposed 12 strokes of caning. Raja, 35, was found guilty by the High Court in 2012 for killing M. Kanan, 42, at a flood retention pond in Lorong Air Jernih, Setapak, Kuala Lumpur, between 1am and 2am on August 24, 2009. He failed in his appeals to overturn his conviction and death sentence at the Court of Appeal in 2013 and Federal Court in 2015. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Zulkpli Abdullah urged the court to uphold the death sentence, citing the extremely brutal nature of the murder and its apparent lack of motive based on the facts of the case. He said on the night of the murder, Raja and a group of his friends went in a van to the location of the deceased. The deceased, who was a transgender woman and worked as a prostitute, was forced to enter the van and have sexual intercourse with Raja, who later stabbed her with a knife. Raja’s lawyer T. Vijayandran had earlier pleaded for the court to give his client a chance to have his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment. Meanwhile, the same panel commuted the death sentence imposed on Indonesian Edi Eko Saputro to 36 years in jail for murdering his lover after allowing his review application under the same Act. Justice Tengku Maimun also sentenced Edi Eko, 39, to 12 strokes of the cane and his jail term to start from the date of his arrest on July 31, 2011. Edi, a labourer, was sentenced to death by the High Court in 2012 for killing Nestriana, also an Indonesian, at a house in Kampung Rumah Sepuluh, Plentong, Masai, Johor, at 10.20am on July 31, 2011. His appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 2014 and by the Federal Court the following year. DPP Mohd Fairuz Johari requested the court to uphold the death sentence, saying that the deceased was struck three times on the head with a bag containing a large rock. However, Edi’s lawyer Choong Kak Sen appealed for it to be commuted to life imprisonment, saying it was “a crime of passion”. He added that his client and the deceased were lovers, and he had struck her after suspecting her of having an affair with another man. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Hamidah Mohamed Deril sentenced Azwan Samsudin, 43, who admitted to transferring RM1,367,530.77 belonging to Helen Tan Boon See, 63, into a bank account under his company AW Builders and Renovation Sdn Bhd. The offence was committed at a premise in Sentul on April 19, and he was charged under Section 424 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, a fine, or both. Subsequently, Azwan and his father-in-law Muhamad Dzulhasymi Ishak, 48, were each sentenced to six months in prison after pleading guilty to the same offence involving RM146,090 belonging to Saw Teong Soon, 48. They transferred the money into the same bank account at 11:18am on January 14 and were charged under the same Act and section. Hamidah ordered both Azwan’s prison sentences to run concurrently from the date of arrest on June 28, while Dzulhasymi was also ordered to begin his prison sentence on the same date. The case was handled by deputy public prosecutor Akmalzatul Mohamed Nawi, while both accused were unrepresented. In a separate Sessions Court, Judge Azrul Darus sentenced Dzulhasymi to six months in prison after he pleaded guilty to a similar offence involving RM757,850 belonging to the same victim (Tan) on April 24 at a premises in Sentul. Azrul ordered the sentence to begin immediately. Deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Amir Haniff Ahijman appeared for the prosecution. According to the facts of the case, the victim had come across the job offer on the Facebook page of ‘pulseplacex’. She then opened an account on a website, where her task was to book hotels through ‘pulseplacex’, and was required to top up her account if the balance was insufficient. She completed the first task and received a return on her money, which led her to believe the job was legitimate. Consequently, she made several transfers into the accused’s bank account between January and April. She was later contacted by ‘pulseplacex,’ informing her that her money could not be returned because the authorities were investigating them. They also demanded more than RM2 million from the victim to avoid being arrested. Both the accused were later apprehended and they could not explain the transfers into Azwan’s company bank account. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, July 3 — The High Court here has dismissed former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s legal bid to obtain a document that he said would allow him to serve his remaining prison sentence under house arrest. In a judicial review application filed on April 1, Najib said an “addendum order” issued by the former king had accompanied a pardons board’s decision in February to halve his 12-year jail sentence for graft in the multibillion-dollar 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal. Najib sought for the court to compel the government to reply to or confirm the existence of the royal order, which he said would entitle him to serve the remainder of his term under house arrest, and to execute the order if it existed. In a copy of the judgment released to the media today, the High Court found there was no arguable case warranting a full hearing of Najib’s application. Judge Amarjeet Singh described affidavits filed by Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and another high-ranking politician from Najib’s party saying they had seen a copy of the royal order as hearsay, and said the government had no legal duty to respond to the application. Najib planned to appeal the decision, his lawyer Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters. “In terms of ethics, the government should have answered,” he said. The pardons board that halved Najib’s term was chaired by former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, whose five-year reign as king ended in January. Najib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state fund 1MDB. The verdict was upheld by the Federal Court in 2022. Malaysian and United States investigators estimate US$4.5 billion (RM21.2 billion) was stolen from 1MDB and more than US$1 billion channelled to accounts linked to Najib. The pardons board in February said Najib was expected to be released in August 2028, six years after he began serving his sentence. It also reduced fines imposed on the ex-Prime Minister, sparking uproar among Malaysians. Najib, who is also considering filing a new petition for a full pardon, remains on trial for corruption in several other 1MDB-linked cases. — Reuters ',\n",

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said all the suspects were locals, aged between 31 and 54. The police received a report on June 24 from a 42-year-old man claiming that his employer’s rented house in Taman Ehsan, Kepong, had been broken into, with the suspects making off with three cars, namely an Audi R8, a Porsche 718 Cayman, and a Suzuki Swift. “At the time of the incident, the complainant’s employer was said to be in China, and losses were estimated to be around RM700,000,” he told a press conference at the Selangor contingent police headquarters today. Based on the information received, the police conducted a series of raids in Kuala Lumpur, Johor Bahru, and Perak, resulting in the arrest of all the suspects, including the group’s mastermind. Initial investigations found that the mastermind, aged 38, had prior records involving drug and criminal offences. “The modus operandi of the group, which has been active for the past year, was to identify houses with luxury vehicles before breaking in and stealing the vehicles. In addition to being sold, these vehicles were used in other criminal activities,” Hussein said. Following the arrests, the police seized four luxury vehicles, including the three stolen in the Kepong incident, as well as various tools used for criminal activities. All the suspects had been remanded until tomorrow, and the case is being investigated under Section 457 and Section 379A of the Penal Code. — Bernama ',\n",

In a unanimous decision reached by a panel of three judges led by Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang, the court dismissed the final appeal by Hazmi Majid, 42, to set aside his conviction and sentence. “The conviction and (death) sentence is safe. This court upholds the sentence as decided by the Court of Appeal and the High Court,” said Judge Rhodzariah, sitting with Datuk Abu Bakar Jais and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera. Earlier, lawyer T. Vijayandran, representing Hazmi, submitted that his client was unaware of his action as he was under the influence of drugs and requested the death sentence to be set aside and replaced with a 30-year imprisonment. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi said the plea of being under the influence of drugs should dismissed as Hazmi attempted to dispose of evidence by washing a towel to remove blood, showing that he was conscious when the incident happened. According to Tetralina, the case meets the requirement of “the rarest of rare cases’ which justifies the death penalty being upheld. “The victim was sent by her mother to the babysitter’s house at 6.45am on the day of the incident, and the child died at 1.30pm. She only weighs 8.26kg, her teeth have not yet grown, and the severe haemorrhaging of the brain means that her chances of survival are slim,” she said. Based on the prosecution evidence, the appellant never offered to help his wife, who was the child’s babysitter, but on that day, he volunteered to bathe the victim. Hazmi was found guilty of killing and causing the death of Nur Muazara Ulfa Mohammad Zainal, or Zara, in a unit at Pangsapuri Sri Cempaka, Bandar Baru Bangi, between 10.30am and 1.30pm on November 7, 2018. The accused is charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which provides for the death penalty, upon conviction. In March last year, the Court of Appeal upheld the death sentence handed down on Hazmi by the Shah Alam High Court on August 20, 2021. In 2019, Hazmi was also sentenced to 13 years in prison and 12 strokes of the cane by the Shah Alam High Court on two counts of sexually abusing the child. He had pleaded guilty to inserting his finger into the 11-month-old infant’s private parts. It was reported that the infant died two days after being in critical condition at Serdang Hospital, believed to be due to physical and sexual abuse by her babysitter’s husband. — Bernama ',\n",

In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Ruzima said evidence given by one of the Thai women was sufficient to prove that Chan had been living on the earnings of the prostitutes. However, the sentence meted out by the Session Court on the accused was excessive and the appellate court panel decided to reduce it to five years’ jail and imposed two strokes of the cane instead of four. Chan, 40, was initially sentenced to eight years in jail and four strokes of the cane by the Session Court in 2022 after being found guilty of committing the offence at an apartment unit on the 22nd floor of Apartment D’ Perdana Sri Cemerlang, Jalan Sri Cemerlang in Kota Bahru at 11.30pm on January 15, 2021.

Penang police chief Datuk Hamzah Ahmad said that a team from the special investigation unit of the Criminal Investigation Department encountered a suspicious Perodua Myvi at the intersection of Jalan Pokok Sena and Jalan Permatang Baru, Sungai Dua, at 2.05am. “The police team then approached the car and instructed the driver to stop the vehicle for inspection.

Hamzah added that further inspection yielded two Glock and SW 38 pistols and 176 bullets in the car. Police investigations also found that they had obtained the firearms from a neighbouring country. The police also conducted checks on the Perodua Myvi used by the two men and found that it was believed to have been stolen. The vehicle belonged to a man in Terengganu, and its road tax had expired in 2021. “Investigations also revealed that the two men had 12 and 13 previous criminal records, respectively.

It was reported on Monday that eight locals were detained in a simultaneous weekend operation in four states for their suspected involvement with Daesh ideology.

On August 2, last year, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction and death sentence. According to the case facts, a police officer approached Firdaus and asked him to open his bags, leading to the discovery of several slabs of compressed dried leaves in one of them, which were later confirmed by the Chemistry Department to be cannabis. In his defence, the accused claimed that the bag did not belong to him but to an Uber driver. He said that he was taking care of it while waiting for the Uber driver to park the car.

Kumar added that the victim was later informed by the syndicate that his profit had reached RM12.9 million as a result of the investment, but he was asked to pay a commission of RM1.6 million before he could access the profit. “The victim refused to pay the commission as he suspected he had been cheated by a fake investment syndicate,” Kumar said, adding that the case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said the man was believed to be directly involved in the case. “To date, we have arrested two individuals and believe more people are involved in this criminal syndicate, which has led to the unauthorised withdrawal of money from fixed deposit accounts,” he said when contacted yesterday. On Saturday (June 15), Ramli said the investigations had revealed the involvement of syndicate members from within and outside the bank, who colluded in facilitating the unauthorised withdrawals. The police received four reports from account holders and bank staff in early June in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, after the victims noticed suspicious cash withdrawals from their fixed deposit accounts made in Kota Kinabalu. The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code, and the authorities are working to track down other individuals involved. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, May 29 — The Federal Court has upheld the death sentence of a former businessman for the murder of a female marketing executive 18 years ago. The three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal, Datuk Nordin Hassan, and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais dismissed Shahril Jaafar’s review application to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. “We wish to reiterate this court is always aligned to compassion and mercy. In our view, this is an exceptional case with exceptional facts,” said Justice Harmindar. He said the deceased (Chee Gaik Yap) had suffered exceptional violence at Shahril’s hands, as the 25-year-old was abducted, sodomised, raped, and killed by Shahril. The crime caused public uproar and shock, as the incident occurred in broad daylight. “We are constrained to dismiss Shahril’s application, and the death sentence is upheld,” said Justice Harmindar. In 2015, Shahril, 43, was found guilty by the Alor Setar High Court of killing Chee, a Universiti Utara Malaysia graduate, near the Cinta Sayang Club in Taman Ria Jaya, Sungai Petani, between 5.30pm on January 14 and 3.05am on January 15, 2006. He was sentenced to death, and his subsequent appeals at the Court of Appeal and Federal Court were dismissed in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Earlier, Shahril’s lawyer Rosli Kamaruddin asked the court to commute the death sentence imposed on his client to life imprisonment. He conveyed Shahril’s remorse and appealed to the court for a chance at redemption, citing his client’s active participation in prison rehabilitation programmes as a testament to his commitment to repent. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Datuk Dusuki Mokhtar, assisted by DPP Solehah Noratikah Ismail, objected to Shahril’s application and urged the court to uphold the death sentence, noting that this is a rare case. He said it was a brutal kidnap, rape, sodomise, and murder of a young lady who had gone jogging with her younger sister, adding that her semi-nude body was found nine hours later in a bush near the jogging track. Dusuki said forensic pathologists found 50 wounds on Chee’s body, including around her private parts where Shahril’s DNA was found. He said Shahril fled to Australia for three years to avoid investigation and arrest. He was finally detained six years later at KLIA upon his arrival from Perth in January 2012. — Bernama ',\n",

Ops Samba 2.0, conducted from March 11 to 25, focused on investigations into members and officers of the Customs Department who were on duty at the cargo section of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), Sepang, which detected the leakage of tax revenue as much as RM2 billion, MACC said in a statement. “This is a huge loss of the country’s revenue and will have a continuous negative impact on the national economy if not curbed,” it said. In the operation, MACC arrested 34 officers and personnel, along with 27 individuals and company owners.  Investigation found that they conspired with a syndicate smuggling, importing and selling contraband cigarettes and liquor. Following the arrest, the MACC’s Anti-Money Laundering Division seized mobile phones, laptops and eight luxury vehicles belonging to the syndicate to facilitate the investigation. The commission also froze a total of 231 bank accounts belonging to companies and individuals, including mule accounts, totalling RM18 million. Ops Samba 2.0 is an operation led by the MACC, together with the Inland Revenue Board and Bank Negara Malaysia, to combat corrupt activities of enforcement agency officers who protect smuggling activities since 2017. — Bernama ',\n",

He said in the second incident, three men assaulted the complainant and his friends using plastic chairs before fleeing. The complainant suffered injuries to his head and hands and the case is being investigated under Section 324 of the Penal Code.

Magistrate Noorelynna Hanim Abd Halim handed down the sentence to Salleh Udoh, 37, and Abdul Malek Az Zukhruf Fiee, 29, after they pleaded guilty to the offence committed at Gate 3 of Istana Negara here at 4.40pm on May 17. The charges were framed under Section 447/451 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34 of the same code, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of six months, a maximum fine of RM3,000, or both. The court ordered both men to serve their jail sentences from the date of their arrest on May 17. The complainant, a police officer serving as a security guard at Gate 3, was approached by a car carrying both defendants, who were attempting to enter the palace. When asked about their purpose for entering the palace, the two men said they wanted to meet the king for matters concerning the afterlife. The complainant then called the control centre, and patrol sector personnel arrived at the scene. A search of the defendants’ vehicle revealed a black-sheathed 45cm machete in the boot. Both defendants were arrested, and investigations revealed they had no legitimate business at Istana Negara. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor R. Harvind sought an appropriate and exemplary punishment for the duo. Both defendants, who were unrepresented, pleaded for leniency, citing family obligations and having no prior criminal records. Later, at the Sessions Court, Salleh pleaded not guilty to illegally possessing a machete at the same location, time and date. For that offence, he was charged under Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act 1958, which carries a minimum prison sentence of five years and a maximum of 10 years, upon conviction. Judge Norina Zainol Abidin granted Salleh bail of RM12,000 with one surety and ordered him to report to the nearest police station once a month until the case is disposed of.

The suspect then seized the victim’s firearm,” he said.

The suspect was shot dead, while the other policeman sustained injuries to his left shoulder and hip. “Our investigation revealed the suspect had come prepared.

The three-member bench, led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, allowed Teh Kim Hong’s review application to commute the death sentence today, under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. In the court’s decision, Justice Tengku Maimun said the death sentence imposed on the accused for the kidnapping and murder offences is set aside and substituted with 40 years’ jail to run concurrently from the date of his arrest on September 15, 2008. Justice Tengku Maimun, who presided with Federal Court judges Datuk Zabariah Mohd Yusof and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, also ordered Teh to be given 17 strokes of the rotan. The 37-year-old was convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court in 2011 for murdering Lai Ying Xin, 16, at Lot 2841, Jalan Alor Bukit Kulai , Kulai Jaya, Johor, at 12an on September 11, 2008.

Teh lost his appeals which were dismissed by the Court of Appeal on May 8, 2013 and by the Federal Court on October 19, 2015. He was charged together with four others. Two minors who were found guilty by the High Court for the offences were ordered to be held at the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong while another person was discharged and acquitted without his defence being called. Teh’s lawyer K.S. Pang requested the court to substitute his client’s death sentence with imprisonment term saying that his client was remorseful and had apologised to the family of the deceased. However, deputy public prosecutor Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir asked the court to uphold the death sentence saying that the accused and his friend had also set the victim’s remains on fire.

This comes after the rejection of Shawal Senin’s application by the three-member panel of judges today to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. “Application is dismissed and the death sentence is maintained,” said Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, who chaired the panel with Federal Court judges Datuk Zabariah Mohd Yusof and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. Shawal, 47, was sentenced to death by the High Court on November 18, 2011, for killing Siwakorn Sukuntha at his residence in Kondominium Pulai View, Taman Kobena, Tampoi, Johor Bahru between 9pm on December 24 and 1pm on December 27, 2008. His appeals to the Court of Appeal and Federal Court were dismissed on April 22, 2013, and January 29, 2015, respectively. Shawal’s counsel Bustaman Menon Abdul Hamid Menon pleaded for leniency to commute the accused’s death sentence to a prison sentence of between 33 years and 35 years. He submitted that although it was a tragic case involving a small boy who was beaten over three days, Shawal’s act did not stem from “a heart of evil” or that he had intended to kill the boy. Abdul Hamid claimed that the accused, who had lost his job and was using drugs at the time, beat the child to discipline him. Deputy public prosecutor Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir objected to Shawal’s application and asked the court to uphold the death sentence imposed on him. She said the accused had repeatedly hit his stepson with his hand, a clothes hanger, feather duster, and a hammer and it was an act of blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life. According to the facts of the case, Shawal got angry and assaulted the child by hand, a hammer, a clothes hanger, and a feather duster and also kicked him when the boy did not respond to his questions. His wife tried to stop him but was warned that she would face the same consequences. The boy’s mother testified that the accused told her he had used a lighter to burn the child’s private parts. Shawal’s last resort is to seek clemency from the Johor Pardons Board. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-judge panel, chaired by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail alongside Mohamed Zaini Mazlan and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, announced the date today after concluding a three-day hearing that began Monday. “The court will deliver its verdict on July 23 at 9am,” Hadhariah said. The six former students are Muhammad Akmal Zuhairi Azmal, Muhammad Azamuddin Mad Sofi, Muhammad Najib Mohd Razi, Muhammad Afif Najmudin Azahat, Mohamad Shobirin Sabri, and Abdoul Hakeem Mohd Ali. The first five defendants were charged with murder under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which carries a mandatory death sentence upon conviction, while Abdoul Hakeem was charged with abetting the murder under Section 109 of the Penal Code, which carries the same penalty. The Kuala Lumpur High Court found the six defendants guilty of intentionally causing injury to Zulfarhan without intent to kill, under Section 304(a) of the Penal Code, which carries a prison sentence of up to 30 years and a fine, if the act is committed with intent to cause death. The defendants were charged with committing the act in a room at the Asrama Jebat block, UPNM, between 4.45am and 5.45am on May 22, 2017. Zulfarhan died at Serdang Hospital on June 1, 2017. On July 23, the court will deliver the verdict on the appeal of 12 more former UPNM students who were found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison for intentionally causing injury to Zulfarhan to coerce a confession that he stole a laptop. The former students were charged under Section 330 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum prison sentence of seven years and a fine, upon conviction. They are Mohd Hafiz Fauzan Ismail, Mohamad Lukhmanul Hakim Mohd Zain, Ahmad Shafwan Berdal, Muhammad Amirul Asraff Mala, Luqman Hakim Shamsuri Agus, Muhammad Sufi Mohd Mustapha, Noriznan Izzairi Noor Azhar, Muhamad Ashraf Abdullah, Muhammad Danial Firdaus Azmir, Muhammad Hasif Ismail, Muhammad Adib Iman Fuad Ady Sani and Mohamad Syazwan Musa. The defendants, now aged 28, were charged with committing the offence in two rooms at the Asrama Jebat block, UPNM, between May 21 and 22, 2017. Earlier, Abdoul Hakeem’s lawyer, Datuk Mohd Zamri Mohd Idrus, argued Zulfarhan had several opportunities to seek medical treatment for his injuries and that no one had prevented him from doing so. “The incident took place in a UPNM room, not in a remote jungle, and many people were around. How come not a single phone call was made to his parents? This is a puzzling question for the lawyers,” he said. “The investigating officer was focused on solely blaming all the defendants. Who will ensure justice for these individuals?” he added. In response to this argument, judge Zaini asked the lawyer: “Are you shifting the blame onto the victim now?” Zamri submitted that many factors contributed to the victim’s death, but to place all the blame on the appellants was not fair. In reply to Zamri’s submission, deputy public prosecutor K. Mangai said there was evidence the appellants did not want to take Zulfarhan to the hospital because they did not want to tarnish their names. “They (appellants) kept him in another room and there was no evidence his phone was with him. “He was in terrible condition, he didn’t go to the roll call and prep class because he was sick, and his body was covered with boils (from the scalding),” she said. Mangai further submitted there was a piece of evidence where the e-hailing driver who brought Zulfarhan to the clinic had to clean the backseat of his car because there was blood and mucous where the victim was sitting. “If the e-hailing driver could see the condition of the deceased, why couldn’t the respondents?” she questioned. — Bernama ',\n",

According to the charges, the two were accused of abetting the suspect, who is still at large, to commit the act, causing a loss of RM3,000. The offence was allegedly committed at Jalan Yap Kwan Seng at 2.17am on May 9. The two accused were charged under Section 109 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 435 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum jail term of 14 years and also liable to a fine if convicted.

Lawyer M.V. Yoges, who represented the two accused, applied for a lower bail on the grounds that Preemraj suffered from seizures and had difficulty walking as a result of being involved in an accident last year, while Rahman’s wife is currently in confinement. The court allowed the two accused bail of RM5,000 in one surety each, as well as an additional condition as requested by the prosecution. It also set June 21 for re-mention. — Bernama ',\n",

Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Rusdi Mohd Isa said preliminary investigations from the arrest of six suspects, including the latest one this morning, found that the motive stemmed from a dispute in business. “The latest suspect arrested is a 23-year-old man who will be remanded this morning and we cannot complete the investigation yet, as there are still two or three others at large and need to be arrested. “All six of these suspects have been remanded; some could not be remanded and some are still in remand,” he said. Rusdi was speaking to the press after attending the monthly meeting at the Kuala Lumpur police contingent headquarters today. He added that all the arrested suspects had their respective roles in the incident, and some of them have criminal records. “This is an isolated case, a dispute between businessmen because some of them were hired to throw the firebomb. But so far, there is no connection with secret societies,” Rusdi said. Two of the six suspects were also investigated under Section 148 of the Penal Code for rioting in a public place using offensive weapons. A closed circuit camera (CCTV) footage went viral on May 9, showing four people on motorcycles throwing petrol bombs in front of the entertainment centre located on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng. The next day, Rusdi said he had obtained statements from the nightspot’s owner and manager to help the investigation. Meanwhile, commenting on the incident of fallen trees along Jalan Pinang on Monday (May 6), he said seven police reports were received from vehicle owners. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge K. Muniandy made the decision after allowing the prosecution’s application to review the Sessions Court’s decision to reject the gag order. In his judgment, Muniandy said it is best if the trial judge hears the case in accordance with the rule of law and procedure without heeding any statement, comment or criticism, which may be levelled in the entirety against the case. “The legal principles cited pertains to the sanctity of the trial, which has to be preserved at all costs. As the charge signifies, which is pursuant to Section 500 read with Section 499 of the Penal Code, its rationale is to prevent any imputation which will harm the reputation of the king,” the judge said. The judge said unlike a civil case, where the aggrieved party is in a position to apply for an injunction to prevent and restrain the offender from repeating the defamatory statement, such an avenue is not available to the prosecution in a criminal proceeding, as once the matter reaches the court, the court takes over conduct of the case to ensure justice is not compromised for the prosecution or the accused. “The institution of a contempt proceeding or the like is a matter to be taken care of eventually when the need arises. Thus, until then, the freshness of issues to be ventilated at the trial as well as sanctity of the trial has to be preserved by the court,” he said. On April 29, Badrul Hisham, 45, was charged with publishing seditious content on his Facebook page in Taman Bukit Cheras here at 12.15pm on April 6. The charge was presented in accordance with Paragraph 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948, punishable under Subsection 4(1) of the same act, and carries a maximum fine of RM5,000, imprisonment not exceeding three years, or both, if convicted. Badrul Hisham was also charged with issuing defamatory statements, with reason to believe that the defamatory statements would damage the good name of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The offence was allegedly committed at the Office of the Istana Negara Comptroller here at 6pm on January 22, under Section 500 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum prison sentence of two years, a fine, or both, if convicted. The court allowed Badrul Hisham bail of RM10,000 with one surety for each charge and rejected the prohibition order requested by the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Kumar said the raid was conducted between 1.30am and 12.20pm, as a result of joint intelligence between the Johor Police contingent headquarters’ (IPK), the Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (JSJN), and the Pontian district police headquarters’ (IPD) JSJN. “Three men, aged 40 to 59, and a woman, aged 75, were arrested in the raid. The female suspect is the older sister of one of the male suspects,” he said during a press conference at the Johor IPK today. Kumar added that the syndicate used the water house as a processing and repackaging centre for the drugs before the drugs were distributed to the local market. It is believed to have been active since February, and the police carried out surveillance on their activities from that time before conducting the raid at the location. “The water house is not a rented premises but the home of the two siblings involved. This house is like any ordinary one, unlike previous locations like gated residential areas or tightly guarded condominiums used for this kind of activity. “We normally would not think a house like this would be used (for processing drugs), but this is a new modus operandi to delude the authorities,” he said. In the raid, police seized 25.5kg of ecstasy powder, 970 Eramin 5 pills, ecstasy pills (1,700 pieces), ketamine (232.60g) and ganja (369.02g), worth RM4.32 million. Various equipment used for processing drugs and packing the ecstasy powder were also seized. “The police also confiscated six cars, RM21,000 in cash, as well as SG$13,000 (RM45,676) in cash,” Kumar said. An ecstasy pill is sold for RM20 in the market, and the drugs seized in the raid could be abused by 88,234 drug addicts. “The role of the elderly woman is still under investigation. We are also investigating the house next to where the raid was conducted,” he said. All the suspects were remanded for a week, ending today, for investigation under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. “We believe there are more syndicate members who are still at large, and we are trying to track them down,” Kumar said. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Zawiyah Saad allowed the application by the plaintiffs, Mohd Rafi Abd Razak, 26, and Anis Amalina Mazlin, 28, after the two female babysitters, aged 58 and 35, failed to appear to respond to the lawsuit on the scheduled date. The couple’s lawyer Muhammad Hariz Md Yusoff told the press that the court recorded the default judgment on May 7 and allowed the plaintiffs’ claims. “However, a new date for the assessment of costs has yet to be determined by the court,” he said during a press briefing at the Kuala Lumpur Court Complex today. Hariz clarified that his client’s legal team had filed the lawsuit in accordance with procedures, but both the defendants, a mother and daughter, were late responding to it. “It is understood that the defendants have also appointed a lawyer after the default judgment was recorded by the court,” he said, flanked by lawyers Nur Fatin Syakinah Kamarudin and Noor Syazwani Mohamad Yusri. According to the lawsuit filed on April 9, the incident occurred on June 15, 2023, when the first plaintiff, the deceased baby’s father, entrusted her to the defendant’s care at 6.48am. However, at 11.40am, he received a call from her saying the baby was in a weakened state, not breathing, and telling him to return urgently. The first plaintiff said he told the babysitter to call for an ambulance immediately. He was later informed by the defendant that his baby had been taken by an ambulance to the hospital, but she did not know where, prompting him to rush to the nearest one, Hospital Putrajaya. “Hospital Putrajaya later confirmed that his baby was no longer breathing despite emergency treatment and confirmed that the baby passed away at 12.17pm on the same day. “I was informed that my baby’s stomach was full of milk as there was a lot of it coming out through her mouth and nose during the emergency procedure,” said the plaintiff in his statement of claim. The plaintiffs demanded damages of over RM100,000 from both defendants, including compensation for grief, special damages, and any other award deemed appropriate by the court. — Bernama ',\n",

Magistrate Illi Marisqa Khalizan, who handed down the sentence on Lee Swee Theng, 59, also ordered the accused to be jailed for three months if he fails to pay the fine. Lee was charged with falsely declaring himself as the father of his adopted son, who is now 17 years old, on the birth registration form at the National Registration Department (JPN) Counter in Kuala Lumpur on December 26, 2007, at 11.36am. The charge, framed under Section 36(1)(b) of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1957, carries a maximum penalty of a RM20,000 fine, imprisonment for up to three years, or both. According to the case facts, when the accused was at the JPN counter in Kuala Lumpur to register the child’s birth certificate, he presented the identity cards of his wife and himself, their marriage certificate, and a birth confirmation letter as supporting documents. The application was received by the counter for processing, and a birth certificate was issued in the teenager’s name. On December 9, 2019, the accused and his son went to the Kampar JPN office in Perak to apply for an identity card when the child was 12 years old, and while the application was being processed, the counter officer noticed a significant difference in skin colour between them. After investigations by Perak JPN, it was found that the accused had been married to his wife since 2001 but had no biological children. Lee admitted to taking the child from a woman known as ‘Ah Song’ and paid her RM3,000 for the child. Earlier, Perak JPN prosecuting officer Mohamad Salleh Jaafar Sidek requested an appropriate punishment as a deterrent as the offence was serious and involved citizenship issues. Lawyer Ernie Sulastri Ahmad from the National Legal Aid Foundation (YBGK) appealed for leniency, citing the accused’s wife’s health condition, as she suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes, requiring insulin and dialysis. “My client deeply regrets the mistake and apologises for it.

       "   'cf1:content': 'SEREMBAN, May 8 — A man was sentenced to 20 years in prison and five lashes by the Sessions Court today after pleading guilty to raping his daughter from the age of 12 until she gave birth. In handing down the sentence upon the 44-year-old, Judge Mohamad Kamil Nizam said the offence committed by the accused was a serious crime. As a result of the accused’s actions, his daughter was traumatised and left with severe psychological scars. “You, as a father, are entrusted to take care of your children but you have done the opposite. “I am aware of the fact that the victim filed a complaint after her parents were arrested by the police for another case…the victim must have felt unsafe staying at home during that period,” he said. According to the charge, the man was accused of having intercourse with his 18-year-old daughter in a village in Port Dickson on November 2, 2022, in accordance with Section 376B (1) of the Code, which carries a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum of 30 years and whipping. Based on the case facts, the victim made a police report stating that she was raped by the accused from the age of 12 until April 21 this year. The teenager never reported the matter to anyone until her mother and the accused were arrested in a narcotics case that made the complainant come forward to file a police report on May 1. The complainant suspected that she was pregnant in December 2022 and gave birth on August 17, 2023, in a hospital. The accused and the complainant’s mother had handed over the child to another person without the complainant’s knowledge. Earlier, the father of four, who was unrepresented, appealed for a lighter sentence on the grounds that he has a young child and a wife who suffers from health problems. Deputy Public Prosecutor M. Kalaivaanan requested the court to sentence the accused to imprisonment for a long period as well as whipping, as the offence committed by the accused is a serious criminal case. Meanwhile, in a different Sessions Court, the accused and his 45-year-old wife were also charged together for possession of drugs, believed to be yaba pills, weighing 32.83g. The pair are accused of committing the offence at the same place at 2.30am on April 28. According to Section 12 (2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, they can be punished under Section 39A (2) of the same Act, which provides for imprisonment for life or a term of not less than five years and whipping. The accused pleaded guilty,, but his wife did not when the charges were read before Judge Meor Sulaiman Ahmad Tarmizi. Deputy public prosecutor Syamimi Farhana Muhammad A Aziz handled the case, and the accused was not represented by a lawyer. The court set July 4 for re-mention of the case. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, May 8 — The Sessions Court has sentenced a businessman to four years in prison today after he was found guilty of deceiving Jakel Trading Sdn Bhd’s legal manager, causing him to incur a RM400,000 loss five years ago. Judge Kamarudin Kamsun imposed the sentence after concluding that the defence had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the case of Mohamed Noor Mohamed Amin, 51, at the end. “….the prosecution succeeded in proving the case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the accused is found guilty and convicted of the charges against him,” said the judge. The court handed down a three-year term for the first charge and a four-year term for the second and third charges, to be served concurrently, commencing today. However, the court allowed the request by the accused’s lawyer Mohamed Haniff Khatri Abdulla to stay the sentence pending an appeal in the High Court, with his bail increased from RM50,000 to RM80,000. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Aiman Azahan requested an appropriate sentence, considering the seriousness of the offence, which involved significant financial losses. Meanwhile, Haniff sought a fine as punishment, citing his client’s dependent family and that he had a tumour. Mohamed Noor was accused of defrauding Jakel Trading’s legal manager Aiman Dazuki, 34, by coaxing him into investing in shares of a fictitious company. The company transferred RM400,000, a sum the victim would not have relinquished without being misled. The offences were committed at the Jakel shopping centre along Jalan Munshi Abdullah in Dang Wangi, between April 15 and June 12, 2019. He was charged under Section 420 of the Penal Code, which is punishable by imprisonment of between one and ten years, whipping, and liable to a fine. On November 8 last year, the accused was ordered to defend himself against the three charges. A total of 17 prosecution witnesses and five defence witnesses, including the accused, testified during the trial. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Mohd Zul Zakiqudin Zulkifli meted out the punishment to the 44-year-old today, after he pleaded guilty to all five charges. The court sentenced the accused to 10 years in prison for one count of rape; eight years in prison each for the other three counts of rape, with 40 strokes of the cane; another two years in prison and two years of police supervision for a sexual assault offence. The judge ordered all prison terms to run separately and ordered the accused to receive a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane under the Criminal Procedure Code. Judge Zakiqudin said the court meted out the sentence after taking into account the repeated offences, the accused’s relationship with the victim and the accused’s guilty plea, which saved the court time. According to the charge sheet, the man was accused raping the then-14-year-old victim four times, in January, February, March, and May last year, in two separate locations, namely at a restaurant and a house in Losong. The father of two was charged under Section 376 (3) of the Penal Code, which provides for a prison sentence of up to 30 years and not less than 10 strokes of the cane. He is also accused of committing physical and sexual assault against the same victim in the same house on December last year, and the charge is framed under Section 14(a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017. Deputy public prosecutor Intan Nor Hilwani Mat Rifin pressed for an appropriate sentence which befits the seriousness of the crimes and serves as a lesson as sexual offences are now becoming more prevalent. The accused, who was unrepresented, expressed remorse for his actions and pleaded for leniency on the grounds that he wanted to look after his elderly mother. — Bernama ',\n",

A panel of three judges, led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, meted out the sentence against Faizol Aznan Muhamad, 43, and Mohd Riduan Ismail, 35, after the court unanimously replaced the conviction under Section 302 of the Penal Code for the offence of murder, to Section 304 (a) of the same law. “Therefore, the sentence under Section 302 of the Penal Code is set aside, and replaced with a 12-year prison sentence, starting from the date of arrest,” she said. The other judges on the bench were Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Mohamed Zaini Mazlan. Faizol and Riduan were arrested in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Earlier, lawyer Ghazali Ismail, representing the two appellants, informed the court that the defence had submitted a representation to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) to amend the charges against the clients from Section 302 of the Penal Code to Section 304 (a) of the same law, and the AGC agreed to it. “The 12-year prison sentence, starting from the date of arrest, was also agreed upon by both parties,” he said. Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Amril Johari also confirmed the matter. The charge, framed under Section 304 (a), was read to Faizol and Riduan, and they later pleaded guilty to the charge. The two were accused of causing the death of Razak Abdullah, 50, also a turtle egg collector, at Pantai Geliga, in front of SK Sri Geliga Chukai, Kemaman, at around 7am on June 3, 2016. The charge was framed under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 30 years and is liable to a fine. Based on the facts of the case, Faizol had an argument with a man, another turtle egg collector, regarding the division of the turtles’ egg-laying area on the beach. The victim, who was at the scene of the incident, tried to calm both parties, which angered Faizol, who then repeatedly hit the victim in the face with a stick. The second accused, Riduan, intervened by hitting the victim in the face with a helmet. On August 9, 2021, the Kuala Terengganu High Court sentenced Faizol and Riduan to death after finding that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubt against the prosecution’s case at the end of the defence case. — Bernama ',\n",

During the proceedings, lawyer Syahril Anuar Harun, representing the accused Mohammad Haikal Mahfuz, 25, requested a date approximately two weeks earlier due to two previous postponements in March and April.

Hamzah Osman’s application for a review of his death sentence under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023 was allowed by a three-member panel today, comprising Federal Court judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal, Datuk Nordin Hassan, and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Harmindar also ordered Hamzah to be given 12 strokes of the cane and for the sentence to run from the date of his arrest on August 21, 2008. Hamzah, now 33, was initially found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court in 2014, but in 2017, the Federal Court ordered a retrial. Then, in 2018, the Ipoh High Court found the accused guilty and sentenced him to death for murdering Norazlida Iden, 31, in Room 202, Suria Beach Resort, Teluk Nipah, Pulau Pangkor, Perak, at 1am on August 18, 2008. He further lost his appeals in the Court of Appeal and Federal court in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir objected to Hamzah’s application to commute his death sentence on the grounds that the deceased was five months pregnant at the time and, therefore, two lives were lost. The accused’s lawyer Ali Munawar Razak appealed for his client to be given a second chance, as Hamzah was 18 years old at the time and has expressed remorse for his actions. According to the case facts, the accused, who was employed by the deceased as a maintenance worker and housekeeper, was said to have disciplinary problems and was often reprimanded by the deceased before he was eventually terminated. However, the deceased allowed him to stay at the resort while looking for a new job. On the day of the incident, the deceased’s husband received news of her death in the room. Later, he found that her belongings, including money, jewellery, a laptop, cell phones, and a digital camera, were missing. A post-mortem revealed that multiple blows from a blunt and hard object inflicted the injuries to the deceased’s head. Police arrested Hamzah and two other men three days later and seized the deceased’s stolen jewellery and handphones from him. Hamzah then led police to recover seven pieces of jewellery from a goldsmith shop, where he had sold them on August 19, 2008, for RM1,500. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Noorin Badaruddin dismissed her appeal to set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Sessions Court in May last year. “The court finds no reason to tamper with the findings of the Sessions Court judge. Therefore, the appellant’s conviction and sentence are safe and upheld. The appellant’s appeal is dismissed,” said the judge. On May 3, 2023, Sessions Court Judge Izralizam Sanusi sentenced Siti Bainun to 12 years in prison after finding her guilty on two charges of neglecting and abusing Bella, 13, and ordered her to start serving the sentence immediately after rejecting her application for a stay of execution. Siti Bainun was sent to Kajang Prison to serve her prison sentence. Judge Noorin also rejected the application by the accused’s lawyer Haijan Omar for a stay of the sentence pending her appeal of today’s verdict filed at the Court of Appeal. In her judgment, she said the court found 18 injuries and scars on the victim’s body, proven by all the medical witnesses that they were not accidental or self-inflicted (by Bella). “The court is satisfied that the Sessions Court judge conducted a thorough assessment of the prosecution witnesses, including eyewitness Yasmin Nahar Mahmood (a former resident of Rumah Bonda), who testified as the fifth prosecution witness (PW5), supported by expert medical witnesses who examined the victim. “The court also finds that the Sessions Court judge did not err in his findings in concluding that, based on all the evidence presented, the appellant was responsible for the physical and emotional injuries inflicted on the victim,” Judge Noorin said. Besides the testimony of PW5, the testimony of PW8, Suhana Zam (a close friend of Siti Bainun), was also supported by medical evidence consistently indicating the injuries sustained by the victim were not accidental. Therefore, the court finds it difficult to conclude that both witnesses fabricated their stories against the appellant. She said the victim is a special-needs child, and the testimony of the prosecution witnesses as a whole completes the prosecution’s narrative that the victim was neglected and abused, resulting in physical and emotional injuries. The court has found the appellant’s defence, claiming that the victim suffered only one scalding, to be inconsistent with the narrative and evidence presented by the prosecution. Judge Noorin said that expert witnesses stated that examinations of the victim revealed that the injuries had occurred at different times because some of them had healed. The testimony provided by these expert witnesses was consistent, whereas the appellant’s and defense witnesses’ accounts of a single hot water spillage was contradictory. “The court found that nearly all the reasons given by the appellant in her petition were repetitions of issues raised during the Sessions Court trial. “The court finds that the issues raised by the appellant and her defense could not raise reasonable doubt about the essence of the charges against her,” the judge said. Regarding the charges, Judge Noorin said that based on the deposition notes, the court found no evidence or circumstances indicating the appellant was confused about the charges against her, rendering her unable to defend herself. The court found that the appellant was adequately notified about the charges from the outset and comprehended the nature of the case concerning how the offenses were committed. The testimonies presented and the extensive cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses indicated that the appellant was aware, not confused, and understood that the charges against her involved neglect and abuse that she had committed, both physically and emotionally, against the victim. “The court is also satisfied that via the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses, the appellant was not prejudiced by the charges presented, whether before or after they were amended by the Sessions Court judge,” Judge Noorin said. According to the charges, Siti Bainun is accused of neglecting and abusing the teenage girl with Down’s syndrome, causing her to suffer physical and emotional injuries at a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju between February and June 2021. Both charges were framed under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment or a fine of RM50,000 or both. The court also ordered the accused to sign a good behaviour bond for five years with a surety and a bond of RM5,000, and to perform 200 hours of community service to be completed within six months after serving the prison sentence. Deputy public prosecutors Zahida Zakaria and Analia Kamaruddin handled the case, while Siti Bainun’s counsel Haijan was assisted by lawyers Nur A’minahtul Mardiah Md Noor and Nurul Hafidzah Hassan. Siti Bainun appeared in court wearing a white robe and a light green headscarf. Speaking to the press after the proceedings, lawyer Datuk Khairul Anwar Rahmat, who was appointed as an observer by the Regent of Johor Tunku Mahkota Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, said Bella is still traumatised despite her injuries having healed. He said that based on clinical assessments, Bella is currently 17 years old, and they have contacted the National Registration Department through the Social Welfare Department to obtain updates on her identification card status. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-member panel of judges chaired by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin unanimously replaced the death sentence by the Shah Alam High Court on Sobri Abdul Wahab with the jail term. Hadhariah said the Shah Alam High Court did not err in its decision to convict the 46-year-old, and there was no merit in the accused’s appeal and plea of insanity at the time of the incident. “Such a claim could not be proven. Therefore, the conviction is upheld, but the death sentence is replaced with a jail term,” she said. Hadhariah ordered Sobri to serve the jail sentence from the date of his arrest on March 10, 2018. On December 31, 2021, the Shah Alam High Court sentenced the accused to death after finding him guilty after he was charged with murdering school canteen helper Gusnima, 38, at her rented apartment in Section U8, Bukit Jelutong, Shah Alam, between 6pm and 8pm on March 10, 2018. The victim, from Medan, Indonesia, was found dead with 14 stabs to her neck, five to the body, four in the stomach, three in the chest, and two to the skull. Earlier, lawyer K.A Ramu, representing Sobri, pleaded that his client was insane and was not under medication at the time of the incident, but Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Siew Wee objected to the plea, claiming the accused was not medically insane because he behaved normally. During the proceeding, the accused was also represented by Khairul Naim Rafidi and Farida Mohammad. Following the amendment to Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court can sentence an accused to not less than 30 years and not more than 40 years if the death penalty is not imposed, and a male convict shall also be punished with whipping of not less 12 strokes of the rotan. — Bernama ',\n",

However, deputy public prosecutor Illya Syaheedah Mohd Razif pressed for just punishment to serve as a lesson to the accused as the incident involved an elderly victim. Based on the case facts, while the victim was in the living room of the house and looking after her granddaughter, the accused and his two accomplices entered the victim’s house armed with a shovel and a stick. The trio asked the elderly woman to hand over money and valuables, as well as threatening to hit the woman’s husband with the shovel if she refused to cooperate. The victim handed over the money and the two mobile phones to the accused in fear before they left the victim’s house with the items. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, April 30 — The Federal Court has commuted the death sentence of a former storekeeper to 30 years in jail for strangling his girlfriend with her headscarf almost 16 years ago. Shahrul Nizam Mohd Shah’s application for a review of his death sentence under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023, was granted today by a three-member panel, including Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, and Federal Court judges Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera. Justice Tengku Maimun, who delivered the court’s decision, set aside the death sentence and substituted it with a 30-year jail term. She ordered the accused to serve the sentence starting from the date of his arrest on October 8, 2008. Shahrul, 51, was found guilty by the High Court in Shah Alam in 2010 for killing his colleague, Nurul Hazira Bharum, 26. He committed the crime after learning that she was going to marry another man. The offence was committed at his rented house in Kampung Gombak, Kuang, Rawang, Selangor, between 9am and 10am on October 7, 2008. His appeals were dismissed by the Court of Appeal and Federal Court in 2012 and 2015, respectively. In his defence, the accused told the High Court that he and Nurul Hazira, a clerk, had planned to commit suicide by drinking poison ‘like Romeo and Juliet,’ claiming that Nurul Hazira forced him to drink the poison first causing him to pass out. Shahrul said that when he woke up, Nurul Hazira was already dead, and he ran to a neighbour’s house for help. He claimed that Nurul Hazira had confided in him, saying she was not in love with the man who proposed to her and instead asked Shahrul to marry her. However, he wanted her to wait as he had no money. A post-mortem report revealed that Nurul Hazira died of suffocation due to strangulation and that no poison was found in her body. His lawyer Subash Ramasamy requested the court to set aside the death sentence and substitute it with a 30-year jail term. Deputy public prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi did not object to the application. — Bernama ',\n",

The panel, comprising Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat and Federal Court judges Datuk Nordin Hassan and Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, allowed Ailias Yahya and Saiful Azlan Shah Abdullah’s review applications under the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023 today. The duo, who have been incarcerated in prison for 18 years and three months, were ordered to serve jail sentences from the date of their arrest on January 22, 2006. The court earlier rejected deputy public prosecutor Tetralina Ahmed Fauzi’s request to uphold the death sentence on the two former policemen, as she said their case falls under the rarest of the rare category. Tetralina told the court that the deceased, Yusrizal Yusuf, 38, was under full control of the two men at all times, from the time of his arrest until his death. She said Yusrizal was shot “execution style” when he was brought to an open space field at KM22, Kuala Lumpur-Kuala Selangor-Batu Arang road, in Gombak, Selangor. The victim was handcuffed and was told to kneel down, and Saiful fired three shots to the head at close range while Ailias stood in front of the victim. However, lawyer Muhammad Fadhli Sutris, representing Ailias and Saiful Azlan, urged the court to give his clients a second chance, as Ailias is suffering from a chronic disease and is wheel-chair bound while Saiful had been admitted to ICU several times. He said Ailias, who had served the Royal Malaysia Police since 1976, and Saiful, who had worked with the police force since 1982, regretted what they had done and asked for mercy from the court as they wanted to meet their families. Ailias, 70, a former corporal and Saiful Azlan, 60, a former lance corporal, were sentenced to death by the Shah Alam High Court in 2011 for killing Yusrizal at Ladang Caledonia KM22 between 10.00pm and 11.30pm on January 13, 2006. They lost their appeals in the Court of Appeal and Federal Court to overturn their convictions and death sentences. According to the case facts, the victim was alleged to have had an affair with the wife of a man who had then lodged a police report after the victim had threatened him. — Bernama ',\n",

The 45-year-old pleaded not guilty after the charge was read before Judge Rasidah Roslee. He is accused of making seditious remarks on his Facebook account under the name ‘Che GuBard’ at 6.30pm on April 26 at Mutiara Villa Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur. The charge is framed under Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 (Act 15), which provides a maximum fine of RM5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both if found guilty. Deputy public prosecutors Datuk Masri Mohd Daud, Abdul Ghafar Ab Latif, Abdul Malik Ayob, and Nadia Mohd Izhar appeared for the prosecution, while Badrul Hisham was represented by Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali. Also present was Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim to hold a watching brief. Earlier, Masri offered bail of RM20,000 in one surety in addition to applying for a gag order so both parties would not issue any comments or public statements on any social media platform until the disposal of the case. However, Rafique requested a lower bail on the grounds that his client supports his wife and four children, including one with disabilities, and only the client’s wife is currently working. He added that the RM20,000 bail offered by the prosecution is high compared with the RM5,000 penalty provided under the Sedition Act. “The client has also been accused of the same offence at the Kuala Lumpur Section Court with bail set at RM10,000 in one surety. “The gag order applied by the prosecution is not specific and is unconstitutional as, according to Article 10, Malaysians have the freedom to discuss matters openly according to the law,” said the lawyer. The accused was then allowed bail of RM10,000 in one surety, and the court rejected the prosecution’s gag order. The court also set June 24 for re-mention. Yesterday, Badrul Hisham was charged in the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court with two counts of inciting and issuing defamatory remarks that would tarnish the good name of His Majesty Sultan Ibrahim, the King of Malaysia. However, he pleaded not guilty after the two charges were read before Judge Siti Aminah Ghazali. — Bernama ',\n",

The three-man panel led by judge Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail also ordered Mohd Azhud Ibrahim, 33, to be given 12 strokes of the rotan. The panel, which comprised Justices Datuk Azmi Ariffin and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah, also dismissed Mohd Azhud’s appeal to overturn his conviction. However, the court substituted the death sentence imposed on Azhud to 30 years’ jail with 12 strokes of the rotan. In affirming the accused’s conviction for the murder offence, Justice Hadhariah said circumstantial evidence showed that it was Azhud who murdered Ahmad Azam Ahmad. The accused was appealing against the February 21, 2023, decision of the Ipoh High Court in sentencing him to death after finding him guilty of killing Ahmad Azam, 43, at a house in Lorong Mohd Ali Kampung Bahagia, Teluk Intan, Perak, at 12.10am on August 10, 2018. According to the case facts, a friend of Azhud who went to the house smelled a foul odour inside the house. He asked the accused about foul odour, and Azhud told him that there was a dead person. The friend said the accused had said “I am angry with him for a long time. I am upset. In his testimony from the dock, Azhud claimed he had no intention of murdering his friend after both were involved in a fight. The accused said he hit his friend to protect himself as his friend was aggressive at that time. Azhud claimed after the fight, he took ganja and slept for two days, and when he woke up, he realised the deceased was lying motionless on the floor and was not breathing. The accused said he had thought of digging a hole at the back of his house to bury Azam’s body but could not bring himself to do it, so he decided to live together with the body. A post mortem report showed that the deceased sustained 23 external injuries and severe injuries to the head and chest. Lawyer Gurbachan Singh, Gobindeep Singh, and Aashwini Rajan represented Mohd Azhud, while deputy public prosecutor Zaki Ashraf Zubir appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Anselm Charles Fernandis imposed the sentence on Kebechi Thomas Nwankwu, 38, and Happy Akhidenor Aituaje, 33, after they pleaded guilty to the charge of possessing 580.98g of cannabis. The offence was committed at the Bukit Beruang Bestari Apartment, Jalan Bukit Beruang, Taman Bukit Beruang Bestari, in Melaka, on March 24, 2022, around 5.30 am.

Lawyer Datin Kharen Jit Kaur, who represented both the accused, appealed for a minimum sentence for her clients on the basis that they had families in Nigeria. However, deputy public prosecutor Mohd Asri Abd Rahman Sidik urged for a stringent penalty, emphasising the importance of public interest over their personal considerations, given the gravity of drug-related offenses. He also stressed that the sentence should serve as a deterrent not only to Malaysians but also to foreigners, aimed at preventing similar offences. — Bernama ',\n",

According to the first charge, he is alleged to have made seditious remarks on his Facebook page at Taman Bukit Cheras at 12.15pm on April 6. The charge is framed under Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 and punishable under the same law, which provides a maximum fine of RM5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both if convicted. Badrul is also alleged to have made defamatory remarks and had reason to believe the statements would tarnish the King’s good name. The offence was allegedly committed at the Office of the Comptroller of Royal Household, Istana Negara, at 6pm on January 22. The charge is framed under Section 500 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment or a fine or both upon conviction. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Syed Faisal Syed Amir offered bail of RM20,000 in one surety for each charge as the offence committed involving the King. “The prosecution is also requesting a gag order so that both parties do not issue any comments or public statements on any social media platform until the disposal of the case. “This is necessary to ensure that the course of the case is not interrupted, in addition to maintaining public order and avoiding provocative comments that will worsen the situation,” he said.

The charge is framed under Section 420 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 34 of the same law, which provides imprisonment for up to 10 years and whipping, and is also liable for a fine upon conviction. Deputy public prosecutor Akmalzatul Mohamed Nawi offered bail of RM300,000 in one surety for each accused and asked both accused to surrender their passports to the court until the case’s disposal. Meanwhile, lawyer Datuk Joy W. Appukuttan, who represented the two accused, asked for a lower bail at RM20,000 as they have to support their families. Judge Datin Sabariah Othman allowed bail of RM80,000 with one surety for each accused, in addition to requiring them to surrender their passports to the court and report to the nearest police station once a month until the case’s disposal.

Judge Datuk Mohamad Abazafree Mohd Abbas acquitted Wan Marzuki Wan Daud, 59, and Naim Azmi, 37, of the charges after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against them at the end of its case. In delivering the judgment, he said several issues were considered, including evidence related to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), house keys, and the ownership of a vehicle parked in front of the house Marzuki rented. “Various DNA samples were also taken, but there was no evidence that their DNA was found on the drugs or firearm. “Therefore, the court acquits and discharges both the accused without calling them to enter their defence,” Abazafree said.

A panel of three judges led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat unanimously allowed the review filed by Mohamad Zulkifli Ismail, 59, under Section 302 of the Penal Code and Sections 2(4) and 3(1) of the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. She set aside the death sentence handed down on Zulkifli by the Kuala Terengganu High Court on May 27, 2018, and ordered him to serve a 35-year jail term starting from the date of his arrest on December 7, 2015. Zulkifli has been imprisoned for nine years. Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim and Federal Court Judge Datuk Nordin Hassan also presided over the case. The Kuala Terengganu High Court sentenced Zulkifli to death after finding him guilty under Section 302 of the Penal Code for killing a scrap metal collector, Zulkefle Abdullah, 37, at a house in Kampung Labohan, Kerteh, at 10.30am on December 7, 2015. On October 25, 2021, he appealed against the decision, but the Federal Court upheld the death sentence. Earlier, lawyer Mazlan Md Zain, appearing for Zulkifli, said the case facts indicated that the appellant was the victim because the incident occurred near his house. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Norzilati Izhani Zainal@Zainol requested the court to uphold the sentence because the crime committed is deemed too heinous as the victim was left to die at the scene. The case went viral on social media, claiming that Zulkifli committed the act in self-defence to fend off a robbery. A group named ‘Save Zulkifli’ was created on Facebook, amassing 71,000 followers and posting various negative statements questioning the police’s authority in arresting the accused. The case is among the 28 reviews heard today during the Federal Court Session held at the Kota Bharu High Court, including cases from the East Coast states. — Bernama ',\n",

Khairul Izani Khairuddin, 36, also known as “Boy Tiger”, was also ordered to be given 12 strokes of the cane. He was ordered to serve the prison sentence from the date of his arrest on November 12, 2018. A three-judge panel consisting of judges Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera (now a Federal Court judge), Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin dismissed Khairul Izani’s appeal to set aside the conviction for murdering Muhammad Qairil Aqmal Abdul Hakim. However, the panel allowed Khairul Izani’s appeal to set aside the death sentence and replace it with a prison sentence. On August 26, 2022, the Klang High Court found Khairul Izani guilty of killing the child and sentenced him to death by hanging. The offence was committed at a house at Jalan Bukit Indah 5, Taman Bukit Indah, Ampang, Selangor at 11am on November 8, 2018. Zaidi, when delivering the court’s decision, said Khairul failed to show that the High Court judge had erred in his finding when dismissing his defence of mental insanity. On the contrary, there was evidence proving that Khairul was sane during the incident as testified by his wife that her husband stopped beating the child after seeing the boy’s head bleeding and immediately took the deceased to a clinic for treatment. He said the accused’s act of lying to the doctor that the boy was injured due to a fall in the bathroom was consistent with the behaviour of a sane person. “We found that the trial judge cannot be said to be wrong in his finding that the accused’s actions in beating the deceased happened because of his hot temper and not because he was mentally unsound,” Zaidi said. Based on the facts of the case, Khairul’s wife saw her husband beating the child repeatedly, stepping on him, strangling the neck, and banging his head against the wall until the boy’s head bled. The woman did not succeed in stopping her husband from beating the child because she was heavily pregnant and also because the accused was a hot-tempered person. Khairul was represented by lawyer Arik Zakri Abdul Kadir, while deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Lawyer Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, representing Muhammad Najib Mohd Razi, said the appeal hearing had been set for May 14 to May 16. “On the same day, the court will also hear the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision to sentence five of the six former UPNM students and 12 others to three years in prison for injuring Zulfarhan,” he told the press after the case came up for mention today. Earlier, at the proceedings, a three-judge panel led by Judge Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail allowed the prosecution’s request to file an appeal petition outside the time limit after Deputy Public Prosecutor Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar did not object to it. The other two judges are Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. All the 18 former UPNM students, now aged 28, attended the proceeding.

Of the six accused, five were charged with the murder of Zulfarhan Osman under Section 302 of the Penal Code, which carries the mandatory death penalty upon conviction, while Abdoul Hakeem was charged with abetting the murder under Section 109 of the same act, which carries a similar sentence. However, in his decision, the judge said the court found all the accused guilty under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code for causing injuries to the deceased (Zulfarhan Osman) with no intent to murder, which carries a jail term of up to 30 years and shall also be liable to a fine, upon conviction. The court also sentenced five of the accused, except Shobirin and their 12 friends after finding them guilty of injuring Zulfarhan. Shobirin was previously charged with the same offence but was acquitted of the charge at the end of the prosecution’s case.

In delivering the court’s decision today, Justice Hadhariahsaid the man’s appeal did not have any merit. Earlier in the proceedings, she said sexual offences against children were rampant. The court also upheld the 27 strokes of caning meted out by the High Court on the 43-year-old man. Justice Hadhariah said the court declined to reduce the number of strokes imposed on the man, although the law states that a convict may be whipped a maximum of 24 times. She added that the court would leave it to prison authorities. The man committed the offences on the girls, then aged 14 and 11, at a convenience store and car park of a religious school in Kampar, Perak, between June 16 and June 17, 2020. He pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexually assaulting the older sister, and the Sessions Court sentenced him to 10 years each, with the sentences to run concurrently. He was also ordered to be given 18 strokes of caning. The man was also sentenced to 10 years in jail for three counts of committing sexual assault on the younger sister. He was ordered to be given another nine strokes of the cane, with the sentences to run concurrently. The Sessions Court ordered for the 10-year jail term to commence after the man had completed serving the 10-year jail for the offences against the older sister. He was ordered to serve the sentence from the date of his arrest on June 20, 2020. On July 21 last year, the High Court reduced the jail sentence of one of the charges from 10 years and three strokes of the cane to three years and no caning.

Baling police chief Supt Shamsudin Mamat said a Patrol Car Unit (MPV) from the Gerik district police headquarters (IPD) in Perak received information from officers on duty at a roadblock in Sungai Lebey, Gerik, at 4am. They were informed of a suspicious Proton Perdana car speeding through the police checkpoint. He said the Gerik MPV had conducted Op Kesan in the surrounding area and tracked down the suspects’ vehicle at a petrol station in Kuala Rui, Gerik. “When police attempted to conduct an inspection, the suspects accelerated the vehicle, prompting the police to pursue the car until it entered the Baling border, Kedah. The Gerik MPV then requested assistance from the Baling MPV. “The suspects’ vehicle was driven in a manner which endangered the lives of road users from the opposite direction, and to prevent the suspect vehicle from colliding with other vehicles, the Gerik MPV patrol members issued three warnings through the ‘spectra’ communication device,” Shamsudin said in a statement today. The suspects refused to stop their car, forcing the patrol car members to fire five warning shots, two of which hit the vehicle’s bonnet. However, the vehicle continued to speed before skidding on the Kuala Pegang Bridge, and two suspects, believed to be the driver and front passenger, fled under the bridge and escaped. He said an inspection of the vehicle found a man and three women believed to be foreigners aged between 23 and 39 without valid identification or travel documents. “The suspects and vehicle were taken to the Baling district police headquarters for further investigation. No casualties were reported in this incident,” Shamsudin said. One suspect, a local man in his 30s who fled, was apprehended at the Gerik Bus Station at 3pm today, while another suspect remains at large. The authorities will also investigate the policemen to determine whether they followed procedures when opening fire. “Police advise the public not to make any speculation that could jeopardise the peace and credibility of any party or ongoing investigations,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Halilah Suboh ordered the two lawyers, Mark Robin Tallala and G. Mahadeva, and their client, Jagmohan Singh Sandhu, to serve the sentence effective today. However, the court allowed the application of lawyer Datuk Harpal Singh Grewal, who represented the three respondents, for a stay of execution of the prison sentence, while waiting for an appeal to be filed in the High Court. Before sentencing, Halilah said the court found the respondents intended to commit contempt of court by preparing and filing false evidence in the form of a witness statement of Allen David Martinez. “As court officers, we all have a responsibility not to mislead the court by submitting dishonest evidence or statements. Each of us has a heavy responsibility and burden in carrying out our respective duties and roles, based on the principles of law and justice. “As lawyers, justice is owed, not only to their respective clients but also to the public and the court. This also becomes the duty of respondents, as defence counsel and lawyers. “In this case, the witness statement was intentionally and dishonestly filed. The respondents knew the witness statement was not the actual Martinez statement. Therefore, they (respondents) deliberately misled this court,” she said. The judge added that if the matter had not been noticed and disclosed before the trial, the impugned statement would have been used during the trial, and interfered with the fairness of the case. “Therefore, the court believes that imprisonment is appropriate, suitable, and reasonable, to be imposed on the three respondents. A fine would not be appropriate, because it would not reflect the seriousness of the offence,” Halilah said. The proceedings were also attended by lawyer Bhavanash Sharma Gurchan Singh as the applicant. On October 13 last year, the Court of Appeal allowed Bhavanash Sharma’s appeal and found the three individuals guilty of contempt of court by preparing and filing false evidence regarding Martinez’s witness statement, filed on February 28, 2020, in the Sessions Court. According to the case facts, the impugned witness statement of Martinez was filed by Mark Robin and Mahadeva, through their firm, on February 28, 2020, without any communication, confirmation, or meeting with Martinez. On March 3, 2020, Martinez filed an affidavit denying each and every answer in the impugned witness statement. Most importantly, he averred that he neither communicated with nor met with the contemnors, prior to the filing of the impugned witness statement. Mark Robin and Mahadeva later admitted to having never met nor sought Martinez’s confirmation before the filing of the impugned witness statement. They blamed Jagmohan and said they relied solely on their client’s instructions, and the supposition the latter had finalised the contents of the impugned witness statement with Martinez. — Bernama ',\n",

MACC Chief Commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said so far, a total of 34 law enforcement personnel and 27 individuals and company owners have been arrested through Ops Samba 2.0 for protecting and facilitating the smuggling activities of the syndicate concerned. He said the law enforcement personnel, aged between 30 and 50, were believed to have received more than RM4.7 million in bribes from the syndicate to facilitate the smuggling of chewing tobacco, cigarettes, alcohol, health products and vehicle spare parts. “(Ops Samba 2.0) is important because we uncover corrupt activities involving enforcement agencies. It is believed to have happened for some time, since 2017 and the losses incurred by the (Malaysian) government because of this syndicate is RM1.5 billion to RM2 billion, which is leakage in tax collection,” he told a press conference, here today. Ops Samba 2.0 is an operation involving the MACC, together with the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), to combat the corrupt activities of enforcement agency officers who protect smuggling activities. Azam said several mobile phones, laptops and eight luxury vehicles belonging to the syndicate had been seized to facilitate the investigation. A total of 232 bank accounts belonging to companies and individuals have also been frozen, he said, adding that they include mule accounts, which involved more than RM17 million. Regarding the syndicate’s modus operandi, he said the syndicate used the service of a ‘forwarding agent’ as a middleman for paying bribes to law enforcers who are in charge of inspection. “This is to smooth the process of smuggling goods without going through the proper declaration and inspection,” he said. Azam said the syndicate was also found to be involved in money laundering activities using business accounts of ‘ghost companies’, money changers, online gambling activities, prostitution activities and also through licensed money lending companies. “A total of 19 ‘ghost companies’ were detected involving various types of business to confuse the authorities, especially the IRB,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

Abd Razak, 71, was ordered to serve his sentence from the date of his arrest on September 3, 2001. The father of two has been in prison for 22 years and six months. Abd Razak, via his lawyer Datuk Baljit Singh Sidhu, had pleaded to the court to be given a second chance and to commute the death sentence imposed to a prison sentence to allow him to spend time with his children and five grandchildren. He was found guilty by the High Court in Johor Bahru in 2006 for killing Rozita Haron, 39, who worked as a hospital cleaner. He committed the offence at his brother’s house in Parit Pecah, Parit Jawa, Muar, on September 3, 2001. In 2009, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision. Abd Razak lost his appeal, which was dismissed by the Federal Court in 2010. Baljit told the press that Abd Razak is expected to be released today following one-third remission of the sentence. — Bernama ',\n",

Mohd Saibulrijal Mohd Saad, 46, made the plea after all the charges against him were read before Judge Azrul Darus. According to 46 charges of document forgery, he was charged with using two documents as genuine, namely a Gold Safe Keeping Service Withdrawal Form and a Letter Of Indemnity, when the documents were fake at a Bangsar bank branch from 9am to 4pm, between October 15, 2019, and January 13, 2021. The charges were made under Section 471 of the Penal Code, punishable under Section 465 of the same Code, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of two years or with a fine or both, if convicted. For the 26 charges of fraud, the accused was charged with defrauding several bank officers by tricking them into believing that some customers wanted to withdraw and buy 117 gold bars using a Gold Safe Keeping Service Withdrawal Form allegedly signed by the customer. All the acts were believed committed at the same bank between 2pm and 4.30pm from July 14, 2020, to August 27, 2021, according to Section 420 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and caning and can be fined, if convicted. Saibulrijal also faces seven charges of misappropriation of property, namely 33 gold bars weighing between 0.05g and one kg belonging to four women at the same location between August 12 and August 24, 2021, under Section 403 of the Penal Code, which carries a prison sentence of between six months to five years and whipping and can also be fined, if found guilty. He also faces one charge of breach of trust by misappropriating two gold bars weighing 0.5kg each belonging to a 75-year-old Datin at the same bank at 1pm, April 12, 2021, according to Section 406 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years with whipping and may be fined, if convicted. Deputy Public Prosecutor Rohaiza Zainal offered bail of RM300,000 with one surety for all charges with the additional condition that the accused’s passport must be submitted to the court and reported to the nearest police station once a month. Saibulrijal, who was unrepresented, appealed for a lighter sentence on the grounds that he had another charge in a different Sessions Court and would be subject to legal action by the bank. “My passport has so far been held, and I cannot go anywhere; please reduce the bail, and the court gives me space to discuss with the family to appoint a lawyer,” he said. The court allowed the accused to be bailed at RM465,000 with one surety for all charges with the additional condition that the passport must be handed over to the court and fixed on April 26 for the mention of the case. On September 27, 2021, Saibulrijal was charged in the Sessions Court on a charge of breach of trust involving RM411,442.17 belonging to an elderly person to buy seven gold bars without the man’s knowledge. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-member panel of judges led by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail sentenced Aaron Teoh Eng Wan and his wife En Sit Mooi to 30 years’ imprisonment, starting from the date of their arrest on May 26, 2017. The two other judges were Justices Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah. Justice Hadhariah, in delivering the court’s decision, set aside the couple’s murder conviction and death sentence, and convicted them on the charge of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. She said High Court judge Datuk Noorin Badaruddin made an error when she did not distinguish the difference between Section 299 and Section 300 of the Penal Code and this warranted appellate intervention. Teoh, 40, and En, 43, were convicted of causing the death of Adrian Teoh Wai Kit, the oldest of their two children, at a premises in the Regalia Business Centre, Subang Jaya, between 2pm and 3.30pm on May 26, 2017. Lawyers S. Jayananda Rao and Saladin Mohd Yasin, representing Teoh and En respectively, argued that the couple should not be convicted of murder but on a lesser charge of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On May 21, 2021, the High Court in Shah Alam sentenced the couple to death after finding them guilty of killing their son. The High Court also sentenced Teoh to eight years in jail for another charge of abuse which resulted in injuries to the victim. However, Teoh withdrew his appeal today against this decision as he has already served the sentence. The testimony of prosecution witnesses such as the chemist confirmed there was deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) belonging to Teoh and the victim on a cane found at the scene and the CCTV recording at the premises showed En dragging the weak and feeble victim several times. Deputy public prosecutor Zulkifli Abdullah appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

The luxury vehicles seized included two Lamborghinis, a Lexus, a Mercedes-Benz, a BMW, a Volvo and two Toyotas. The source also said that the operation was carried out by MACC’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Division, in collaboration with the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). “The vehicles were seized from several individuals who held positions as company owners, as well as middlemen who made bribe payments to officials at an enforcement agency. “The syndicate was also found to have carried out money-laundering activities, using ‘ghost company’ accounts, through licensed moneylenders and moneychangers,” he said. The source said the syndicate’s smuggling activities were believed to have caused tax revenue losses, estimated at more than RM400 million, and involved bribes of more than RM8 million to several individuals, including civil servants, to enable the smuggling activities. “This syndicate is believed to have used a modus operandi of using mule accounts to make payment transactions to civil servants who are in cahoots,” said the source.

In the first case, the Federal Court commuted the death sentence of an Indonesian man to 30 years imprisonment for murdering his girlfriend for ending their relationship. Court of Appeal President Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who led a three-member panel with Federal Court judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil, also ordered Untung (one name only) to be given 12 strokes of the cane. The 42-year-old construction worker was ordered to serve the prison sentence from December 23, 2018, the date of his arrest. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Abang Iskandar said there was no merit in the accused’s appeal. On August 6, 2020, Untung was sentenced to death by the High Court for killing Indonesian Asmaul Chasanah, 28, at the Masjid Al-Husna car park in Bandar Sunway, Petaling Jaya, at 10.15pm on December 22, 2018. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal on October 6, 2022. Based on the case details, Untung acquired a bottle of pesticide, carried a kitchen knife, and waited for Asmaul in the car park. He confided in her, expressing sadness and revealing his intention to commit suicide. Subsequently, he consumed the pesticide and stabbed himself. Instead of leaving the place, Asmaul mocked and insulted Untung, which provoked and led him to stab her. Deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution, while lawyers Gooi Soon Seng and Lim Wei Qi represented Untung. The second case saw the Court of Appeal commute an unemployed man’s death sentence to 35 years imprisonment for killing his girlfriend’s six-year-old son Muhammad Rayyan Hidayat Hairil Khan in 2018. The three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin also ordered Noraizuwan Hamali to be given 12 strokes of the cane and to serve the term from the date of his arrest on April 19, 2018. The court, however, dismissed Noraizuwan’s appeal to overturn his murder conviction. Noraizuwan, 32, was sentenced to death by the Kangar High Court on January 21, 2022, after he was found guilty of killing Rayyan at a house in Kampung Jejawi, Kangar, Perlis between 3.35pm on April 18, 2018, and 12.10am the following day.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, March 12 — The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) arrested four civil servants and is still looking for another individual for suspected bribery of over RM5 million from a tobacco, cigarette and alcohol smuggling syndicate via the country’s gateways. According to sources, the four men, in their 40s and 50s, were arrested in the Klang Valley between 11 am and 4 pm yesterday in a special operation by MACC’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Division, the Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) and Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). The men have been remanded for four days from today to Friday (March 15) after Magistrate Irza Zulaikha Rohanuddin allowed the anti-corruption agency’s application at the Putrajaya Magistrate’s Court. In the operation, the MACC arrested eight individuals, including the four civil servants, who are believed to have been conspiring with the syndicate from 2018 to 2023. “So far, the syndicate is believed to have caused a leakage in tax revenue estimated at about RM400 million and has given more than RM8 million in bribes to several individuals including civil servants to smuggle chewing tobacco, cigarettes, alcohol and several other items,” said the source. MACC AML also seized various items such as handphones, laptops, personal computers, cash, houses and cars, with an estimated worth of nearly RM6 million, in addition to freezing 237 bank accounts involving a total of almost RM12 million. “The syndicate is believed to be using a modus operandi of using mule accounts to make (bribe) payment transactions to civil servants who conspire with them,” said the source. “Apart from this, the syndicate also was also found to be involved in money laundering activities by laundering money using ‘ghost company’ business accounts, through money changers and licensed moneylending companies,” added the source. MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki when contacted confirmed the arrests and said the case is being investigated under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act 2009 and Section 165 of the Penal Code. He also said the MACC will also apply for remand against more individuals arrested under Section 17(b) of the MACC Act 2009. — Bernama ',\n",

The shoot-out occurred at about 11.30am and ended with two Vietnamese men and a Bangladeshi, aged 36, 44 and 38 respectively, found dead in a car. Pahang police chief Datuk Seri Yahaya Othman said the car was earlier spotted in a suspicious manner in the area of the Pahang State Development Board in Pekan by a police team from the Criminal Investigation Department of the Selangor and Pahang police. He said the police ordered the car to stop, but the driver sped off towards Jalan Pekan-Kuantan bypass. “A high-speed chase ensued before the suspects rammed their car into the rear of the police patrol car and their car came to a halt. When policemen stepped out to inspect the vehicle, the suspect fired several shots at the police. “In self-defence, the police returned fire, killing the three men in the car and a search in the car also found a Glock 17 pistol along with seven bullets and three bullet casings,” he told a press conference at Pahang police contingent headquarters here today. He said the police also found several items including drills and grinders, machetes and iron hammers in the car, which belonged to the Bangladeshi suspect. The two Vietnamese suspects had passports and entered the country as visitors, while the police were still checking the background of the Bangladeshi suspect, he added. He said the modus operandi of the suspects was to break into jewellery shops and then drill the safe using a grinder before fleeing with the loot. Yahaya said the case was being investigated under section 307 of the Penal Code for attempted murder. Following the death of the three suspects, the police believed they had resolved six cases of gold-shop robberies reported since June last year, involving a case each in Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang, and three cases in Perak. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, March 11 — The Court of Appeal today upheld the 30-year imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane sentence imposed on two friends convicted of distributing nearly 10 kg of drugs in a car five years ago. A panel of three judges led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail unanimously rejected the appeal of Mohd Khairul Azwan Zakaria, 37, and Bhahira Fakri, 43, to set aside the conviction and sentence handed down by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on February 16, 2023. In her judgment, Judge Hadhariah stated that the failure to call the owner of the car (Honda Accord) to testify did not create a loophole in the prosecution’s case because the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the appellants were found on the cloth inside the boot of the car. “This means that the appellants had access to the car, and the drugs were not concealed; the appellants also fled when the police attempted to arrest them. “According to the footage from closed-circuit television, the appellants used the car for two days. Therefore, the failure to call the car owner cannot raise inferences contradicting the prosecution’s case,” said Judge Hadhariah, who presided alongside Datuk Azmi Ariffin and Datuk Noorin Badaruddin. She said the court did not see breaks in the evidence chain as the items in the case had been marked, and there was no dispute regarding the matter. “In our opinion, the case items submitted in court are those seized from the car. Therefore, the conviction stands, the appellants’ appeal is dismissed and the conviction and sentence by the High Court are upheld,” she added. Lawyers Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, appearing for Mohd Khairul Azwan and Muhammad Hafizuddin Salehuddin representing Bhahira, as well as Deputy Public Prosecutors Mohd Fuad Abdul Aziz and Ng Siew Wee, attended the proceedings. Mohd Khairul Azwan and Bhahira were jointly accused of distributing 9573.1g of heroin and 115.5 g of  Monoacetylmorphine inside a car in the parking area in front of an eatery at Publika 1, Jalan Dutamas 1, Solaris Dutamas in Kuala Lumpur, at 11.40 am on June 20, 2019. The charges were framed under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drug Act 1952, which carries penalties under Section 39B(2) of the same Act, and read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code that provides for the death penalty or life imprisonment. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Lim Hock Leng handed down the sentence on Tai Chee Khiong, 51, after finding that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubt against the prosecution’s case. In his judgement, Lim said that although it was the accused’s first offence, the amount of drug seized was believed to be the largest in Sabah. In fact, the amount of drugs in the case exceeded the accumulated amount in all five drug cases tried in the court over the past three years. “The accused did not show any remorse and did not respond, nor did the defence counsel, despite being given the opportunity by the court to say something before sentence is meted outed,” said the judge. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Hurman Hussain requested the court to consider imposing the death penalty, taking into account the number of drugs involved and the public interest. Also appearing for the prosecution was Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohd Suhaimi Suriana. Tai, represented by lawyer Darmin Achok, was charged on Oct 13, 2021, with trafficking nearly 200kg of syabu in Kampung Batu Payung at 7.30am on September 6, 2021. He was charged under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which provides the death penalty or life imprisonment, and if not sentenced to death, must be punished with no less than 15 lashes upon conviction. Meanwhile, according to the prosecution, the death sentence imposed by the Tawau High Court today was the first to be handed down after the Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Act 2023 (Act 846) came into effect on July 4 last year. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, March 5 — A former female clerk and her two friends escaped the gallows when the Court of Appeal commuted their death sentence today to 35 years in jail for abducting and murdering a company managing director, whose body was dumped over the Penang Second Bridge, nine years ago. This was after the three-member panel chaired by Judge Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera unanimously set aside the death sentence handed down by the Shah Alam High Court in 2018 against Sunil Singh, A. Malarvili, and C. Kavin Mukilan, for the murder of 68-year-old Balveer Kaur. Today, the appeals court also ordered Sunil, the former driver of the deceased, and Kavi Mukilan to be given 12 strokes of the rotan for the murder offence and another three strokes of the rotan for abduction. The total number of lashings that will be imposed on them is 15 but Malarvili was spared the whipping as the law prohibits such punishment on female offenders. In his broad judgment, Judge Vazeer said their lawyers had conceded there was an abduction but there was no evidence of demand made for a RM2 million ransom. “However, there were two phone calls made two hours after the abduction and the caller was a lady. The trial judge held there was overwhelming evidence it was Malarvili,” he said. The judge also pointed out the trial judge made a correct finding in calling the trio to enter their defence for murder and they were not denied a fair trial. “They knew very well the prosecution’s case against them. They had intentionally caused the death of the deceased by suffocating her by allegedly covering her nose and mouth and throwing the body into the sea,” said the judge. The other judges on the bench were Datuk Wong Kian Kheong and Datuk Noorin Badaruddin. The prosecution was led by deputy public prosecutor Noorhisham Jaafar while Malarvili and Kavin Mukilan were represented by lawyers Jasmine Cheong and Afifuddin Ahmad Hafifi, while counsel Amer Hamzah Arshad, Chew Jee San, Kitson Foong, and Joshua Tay appeared for Sunil. On December 27, 2018, the High Court Judge Datuk Zulkifli Bakar sentenced the trio to death for murdering Balveer Kaur at Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan, Perak, at 11.02pm on February 13, 2015. They were alleged to have covered the victim’s mouth, until she suffocated to death, and then threw the body into the sea, and charged under Section 302 of the Penal Code which carries the death sentence, if found guilty. They were also found guilty of abducting Balveer Kaur and wrongfully confining her for ransom of RM2 million at a construction site in Sunway Pyramid, Bandar Sunway, at 12pm until 5.53pm, on February 13, 2015. The offence, under Section 3 of the Kidnapping Act 1961, carries the death sentence or life imprisonment, and shall, if not sentenced to death, also be liable to whipping, if found guilty. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (JSJK) director, Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said police have identified a trend in which companies are registered for ‘dummy’ accounts to be used. He said this tactic has been a preferred choice because it allows financial transactions to be carried out more frequently, involving larger amounts. “So besides individual mule accounts, there are now also corporate mule accounts that pose a greater financial threat because transactions disguised as company transactions involve amounts that can reach billions of ringgit. “To curb this, JSJK sees the need to strengthen the Semakmule portal by adding another module, listing companies suspected of being involved in commercial crime activities. That’s why Semakmule 2.0 has been established,” he told reporters after launching the Semakmule 2.0 portal at Mid Valley Megamall here today. Ramli said with the portal, the public will know which companies are involved in commercial crimes and avoid dealing with them. “A total of 107 companies have been listed in the Semakmule 2.0 database, and this number will continue to grow over time in line with ongoing investigations and new cases received every day. It is hoped that the public will use this portal to avoid falling victim to scams,” he said. Ramli also said in the first two months of the year, a total of 6,283 commercial crime cases were recorded, involving losses amounting to RM664.59 million, compared to 6,544 cases involving RM265.81 million during the same period last year. — Bernama ',\n",

The offence was allegedly committed in the back alley of a restaurant on Jalan Masjid India, Dang Wangi, at 2.10pm on February 19.

Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, heading a three-member panel of judges, rejected the appeal of former electrician, Taufeeq Mohsein Ahmad Tahir, 38. She said the conviction of the appellant was deemed safe. Hadhariah reading the unanimous decision, said the 12th prosecution witness (SP12) and SP13, who are the children of the accused and deceased were eyewitnesses, and the High Court judge had made a factual finding that the two were credible witnesses. Regarding the punishment, the judge said the court adopted the Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Act 2023 (Act 846) which gives the court discretion to impose the death penalty or imprisonment. “Therefore, the court set aside the death sentence handed down by the High Court and replaced it with a prison sentence of 30 years from the date of arrest (July 7, 2019) and 12 strokes of the rotan,” said Hadhariah, who sat with judges Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. Taufeeq Mohsein appealed against the decision of the Kuala Lumpur High Court on June 7, 2022 which sentenced him to death after he was found guilty of murdering Siti Noorasny Md Zain at PPR Desa Tun Razak, Cheras between 8 pm, on July 6, 2019 and 2.48 am, on July 7, 2019, according to Section 302 of the Penal Code. Earlier, Taufeeq Mohsein’s lawyer M. Manoharan argued that there was no evidence that the two siblings (SP12 and SP13) witnessed the incident as both of them could not confirm what happened on the day in question. According to Manoharan, there is serious doubt as to whether injuries or other things caused the death of the deceased following the chemical report and autopsy clearly showing the presence of drugs in the blood and bile of the deceased. “The deceased was a ‘drug addict’ and it is possible that the drugs taken by the deceased could have caused death,” said Manoharan, who appeared together with co-counsels Johan Ariff and M. Hariharan. Deputy Public Prosecutor Eyu Ghim Siang argued that there were 51 injuries on the deceased and this (finding) was supported by the testimony of SP11, who was the pathologist who performed the autopsy on the body of the deceased. “SP11 in his testimony said the pattern of injuries on the deceased was caused by a blunt object and not because the deceased fell on her own. SP11 believed the cause of the deceased’s death was due to ‘multiple blunt force trauma to the body’,” he said. Eyu also said that the testimony from SP12 and SP13, who are child witnesses, showed that their father hit, punched and kicked the deceased. “SP12 saw the appellant holding the ‘blunt object’ and hitting the deceased with it while SP13 saw his father punching and kicking their mother,” he added. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (CID) director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said despite facing challenges including identifying the primary location of the murder, the police had not given up and are still scrutinising every piece of information gathered so far to solve the case. He said every expertise available in the CID, including the forensic aspect, has been deployed to ensure that the criminals responsible can be brought to justice. “At this time, my team still looking at the technical part. Most forensic results are already in and the challenge we are facing now is that we cannot identify the primary location of the incident…what we have is the secondary location. “We are still doing the triangulation, in addition to refining some technical matters including the statements collected from the public,” he said in an interview recently. Mohd Shuhaily said they expected to have a new lead after the Selangor Malaysian Crime Prevention Foundation (MCPF) deputy chairman Datuk Seri A Thaiveegan offered a reward of RM20,000 for information that would lead to the arrest of Zayn Rayyan’s murderer. “Maybe the RM20,000 reward would motivate those who witnessed the crime to come out and give us a new lead. Rest assured that we will process any lead we have,” he said. At the same time, Mohd Suhaily also advised the public not to pressure Zayn Rayyan’s parents by associating them with the murder of their son. On December 5, a day before the tragic discovery, the boy’s mother shared on Facebook that her son had gone missing while they were climbing the stairs to their home at Apartment Idaman in Damansara Damai, after going to a nearby playground. The lifeless body of the six-year-old Zayn Rayyan was found in a stream, 200 metres from the apartment, the following day. Though initially classified as a missing child and sudden death case, the autopsy results revealed that the boy was murdered based on defensive wounds found on his body. The case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code. — Bernama ',\n",

JPJ Senior Director of Enforcement Datuk Lokman Jamaan said the drivers were found using prohibited substances based on inspections carried out in collaboration with other government agencies at bus terminals before they left for their designated journey. “All those involved are local citizens and are believed to be using drugs like syabu (crystal meth), methamphetamine (creates hyperactivity to stay awake) and ganja (THC). We believe they took drugs supposedly as stimulants to energise and stay alert to drive long distances. “But the downside of its use are side effects which endanger the lives of passengers,” he at a press conference after the 2024 Chinese New Year Special Ops in Gambang here today, which was also attended by Pahang JPJ director Kamarul Iskandar Nordin. Lokman said JPJ would also notify the operating bus company involved and the reports of the investigation would be submitted to the Land Public Transport Agency (APAD) for action to be taken under the Act. In addition, JPJ also suspended the licences of all the drivers involved under Section 36 of the JPJ Act after further confirmation was obtained from the National Anti-Drugs Agency (AADK). “When the urine test is positive, we ask the bus company to change the driver involved to another driver to continue the journey for the safety of the passengers,” he said. During the implementation of the operation, Lokman said a total of 21,705 public transport vehicles (KPA) were inspected as of today, with 32 of them confiscated while 1,181 summonses were issued for various road offences. Among the fines issued are related to technical offences such as faulty brake, which contributed to 266 summonses or 22.5 per cent and 91 summonses or 7.7 per cent for driving without a valid licence. “The Special Ops will continue until Feb 29, covering inspections of various types of vehicles to ensure compliance with road safety rules and laws in addition to inspections of public transport vehicles to ensure smooth transportation,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said the case reported in Kajang earlier this month was the highest recorded loss for cases involving impersonation of NSRC officers. “In those cases, the victims will receive a call from an individual claiming to be an official from the NSRC who told them the NSRC would cancel their phone numbers due to complaints that the phone numbers were used to send illegal links and fraudulent messages. “For investigation purposes, the call would then be transferred to another individual posing as a police officer,” he said at the CCID weekly press conference here today. In the former lecturer’s case, he said the 61-year-old woman was duped by various instructions given by the imposters to transfer all her money to their accounts. Ramli said the NRSC communication is a one-way communication, and it will not make calls to any individual and any call claiming to be from NSRC is a fraud. Meanwhile, Ramli said that from January 1 to February 11, the CCID had opened 18 investigation papers regarding cases of fake NSRC officers involving losses of RM1.4 million. “To optimise efforts to eradicate and prevent online scam crimes, the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) urges the victims to immediately contact the NSRC at 997 to report the incident. “Ideally, the call should be made in less than 24 hours so that the chances of blocking the money that has been transferred is higher,” he added. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department (CCID) director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said that the value of the recorded losses also increased by 207.6 per cent during that period. “Changes in the commercial crime scene require the diligence and determination of CCID personnel to provide the best service, especially from the aspect of investigation and eradication. “From January 1 to February 11, 2024, a total of 2,065 investigation papers have been successfully initiated, with suspects charged, equivalent to 49 per cent of the total investigation papers opened,” he said in CCID’s weekly press conference, today. He said that the number was higher than the number recorded for the same period in 2023, which stood at 1,736. He added that the increasing trend and value of losses recorded pose a challenge to CCID, and this requires that efforts to combat this commercial crime activity be intensified, to combat it completely. “Apart from that, the involvement of every layer of society is very important in playing their respective roles, especially in the prevention of commercial crime,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

Rumah Bonda, through its chairman Siti Bainun Ahd Razali, filed the judicial review application on Aug 13, 2021, naming the director of the Federal Territory JKM and the Minister of Women, Family and Community Development as the first and second respondents. Lawyer Asiah Abd Jalil, representing Rumah Bonda, said that Judge Datuk Ahmad Kamal Md Shahid set the date after hearing submissions from both parties via Zoom today. “The decision will be delivered via Zoom at 10 am,” said the lawyer told reporters. On November 15, 2021, the High Court, in allowing an objection by the Attorney-General’s Chambers, dismissed Rumah Bonda’s application for leave to initiate a judicial review of the action by JKM in sealing its premises at Taman Setapak. The action by JKM followed the alleged abuse of a Down Syndrome teenager known as Bella. On July 25, 2023, the Court of Appeal ordered the judicial review application by Rumah Bonda to be reverted for hearing at the High Court after a panel of three Court of Appeal judges, in a unanimous decision, said there was merit in Rumah Bonda’s appeal. In the application, Siti Bainun stated, among others, that the seal order issued by JKM on July 9, 2021, and the sealing of the premises on July 12 were influenced by public pressure, following media reports on allegations of child abuse at the home which went viral on July 5. Siti Bainun claimed that the action by both respondents was done in haste following public pressure for JKM and the government to take action with regard to the alleged abuse case at the premises. On May 3, 2023, the Sessions Court ordered Siti Bainun to serve a 12-year prison sentence after finding her guilty of two charges of neglecting and abusing Bella in a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju here between February and June 2021. — Bernama ',\n",

Immigration director-general Datuk Ruslin Jusoh said the raid was conducted by a team of officers and rank and file from the Intelligence and Special Operations Division of the Putrajaya Immigration Headquarters and Special Tactical Team (Pastak) following two weeks of intelligence and complaints received. He said the two masterminds, a 28-year-old Indian national and a 31-year-old Bangladeshi, and the other two suspects, both 28-year-old Bangladeshis were arrested in the premises during the operation, which began at 2 pm. “They were all detained for not having valid passes to be in the country,” he said in a statement today. Ruslin said they also seized four Indian passports and one Pakistan passport belonging to other people, one Indian passport and one Pakistan passport believed to be fake, a Bangladesh passport as well as 26 Temporary Employment Visit Passes (PLKS) also suspected to be forged. They also seized two Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) cards, which are believed to be fake, two laptops and a printer. “The syndicate’s modus operandi is to target foreign citizens, like Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, who faced problems in Malaysia such as not having identification documents and visas. “The suspects will find and get close to those with these problems before offering their services, such as fake passports, PLKS and CIDB cards,” he said. Ruslin said the syndicate is believed to have been operating for a year and charged around RM1,000 for each passport and RM500 each for the PLKS and CIDB card. All four are being held at the Putrajaya Immigration Depot for investigation under the Immigration Act 1959/63, the Passports Act 1966 and the Immigration Regulations 1963. — Bernama ',\n",

Fikri Abu Bakar, 58, pleaded not guilty after all the charges against him were read before Judge Suzana Hussin. According to the charges, Fikri, as the director of Fikri Rice Sdn Bhd, through his company’s staff, submitted 28 invoices, totalling more than RM8.9 million, to claim Trade Working Capital Financing Islamic financing facilities for the purchase of rice, to the agent of Agrobank Bhd. However, the invoices contained false statements, and no rice was purchased by the company. All the offences were allegedly committed at Menara Wisma Maran, here, between November 18, 2019 and January 16, 2020. All charges are framed under Section 18 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, which can be punished under Section 24 (2) of the same law, which carries a maximum jail term of up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the value of the claims or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction. Fikri, who is also the son of the founder of the rice company, is also facing 28 alternative charges. He is alleged to have used 28 fake invoices, involving a similar amount (RM8.9 million), at the same place and date. For the alternative charges, he is charged under Section 471 of the Penal Code, and can be punished under Section 465 of the same law which carries a maximum jail term of two years or a fine, or both, if convicted. Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy public prosecutor, Mohammad Fadhly Mohd Zamry, did not offer bail on the grounds that the offence is non-bailable. “If the court uses its discretion to grant bail, the prosecution proposes bail of RM200,000 in one surety for 28 charges, with additional conditions that the accused must report to the MACC Office in Putrajaya once a month and surrender his passport to the court, as well as not disturbing the prosecution’s witnesses until the disposal of the case,” he said. Lawyer Muhammad Nizamuddin Abdul Hamid, who represented the accused, appealed for a lower bail on the grounds that his client supports his family and is a diabetic patient. “Yesterday, my client was just discharged from the hospital due to a bone infection in his big toe, and he also does not have stable finances and is unable to pay the amount of bail proposed by the prosecution. “Therefore, I am requesting bail of RM50,000, in addition to not objecting to the additional conditions,” he said. The court allowed the accused a bail of RM100,000 in one surety for all charges, with additional conditions as requested by the prosecution, and fixed March 25 for the mention of the case for the submission of documents. — Bernama ',\n",

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said police received reports from the two victims about their losses and that investigations had been initiated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. In the first case involving the 61-year-old professor, a suspect had contacted the professor, claiming that he was an officer from the National Scam Response Centre (NSRC) and informed the victim that she was carrying out illegal gambling activities and also involved in money laundering. “She however, denied her involvement in such activities but was directed to place two bank cards by the roadside for the suspect to pick up. She later realised that 262 transactions were carried out using the cards and involved RM1.43 million from her two bank accounts,” he said in a statement today. Hussien said the second case involved a 55-year-old accountant who suffered losses amounting to RM5.04 million after being scammed of high returns through a cryptocurrency investment scheme. “In the month of August, the victim was befriended by a man who had introduced himself as ‘Willian’ via WhatsApp. Willian had offered huge profits in a short term through the scheme. “The victim who was attracted by the huge profits offered in a short-term, agreed to invest in the scheme and the victim was taught how to transfer money into an e-wallet account involving 143 transactions. After the transactions were done, the account was not accesible and the suspect had ‘disappeared’, he said. Hussien advised members of the public to not entertain telephone calls from unknown individuals an that police or other government departments will not carry out investigations related to bank accounts of individuals, especially online. “Banking and automatic cash withdrawal (ATM) details belong to individuals, and should not be made known to others, especially to strangers. “As for cryptocurrency, police urged members of the public to not be carried away by advetisements that offer high returns for the investments or shares through social media platforms.

Selangor police chief Datuk Hussein Omar Khan said following intelligence gathered, the individuals, aged between 25 and 53, were detained at their respective homes and 11 pump gun barrels, 55 bullets and a car were seized. “In the raid, it was discovered that after completing their shifts, the guards were storing their firearms at home, placing them under the bed, beside or inside their wardrobe and even in their car,” he told a press conference here today. He said that investigations showed the security guards also transported the firearm on their motorcycles in an unsafe manner, without securing them properly. They claimed they were instructed by their company to keep the weapons at home after work. He said this had been ongoing for about two years, adding that the security company which was licenced in Kuala Lumpur was also found to have committed five offences since 2015. He said the male guards, all locals, were found to have violated licencing conditions under Section 8 (b) of the Firearms Act 1960, which if convicted, could face up to seven years in prison or a fine of RM10,000. Meanwhile, the police are investigating the security company involved, and if found guilty, their licence could be revoked. Hussein urged companies holding firearms to adhere to licencing conditions to prevent incidents such as armed robberies, extortion or firearm loss and theft. “Security companies should prioritise firearm safety, including opening branches where they operate and constructing firearm-proof rooms, rather than cutting costs.” — Bernama ',\n",

He said preliminary investigations found that the syndicate, which has been active since January this year, will send short messages via WhatsApp containing links to online job advertisements to people selected at random in the United Kingdom. “After the victim replies and expresses interest in the job offer, the person will be asked to register an account at the ‘Globesailor V88’ link. In the link, the victim is instructed to complete a task such as to ‘like’ certain advertisements by paying a deposit in USDT cryptocurrency. “The victims are offered a commission of 0.5 per cent to five per cent for each successful assignment, and to convince the victim that the commission has been paid, a receipt will be issued,” he told a press conference at the Sentul District Police Headquarters here today. The syndicate is believed to be able to make a profit of up to US$3,000 a day, he said, adding that the case was investigated according to Section 420/511 of the Penal Code.

Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin made the decision in the case of T.S. Gabriel Samson, 35, after finding that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against the accused. “The court found that the drugs in question were not in the possession of the accused alone but belonged to another individual. While being questioned by the third prosecution witness, a policeman, the man (the other individual) disclosed where the drugs were kept. “If the man is called to testify, he can explain the issue of the drugs found, whether the accused was involved in the distribution or not. I also found that the man had access to the house because only those with access to the house and the drugs could disclose where the drugs were stored. “Therefore, it is not safe for me to call the accused to defend himself because of the gap in the prosecution’s case. With this, the accused is discharged and acquitted of the two charges he is facing,” said the judge. Gabriel was charged with distributing 1278.61 grams of cannabis at a condominium unit in Jalan Pahang, Wangsa Maju here at 10.15 pm, February 5, 2021, in accordance with Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act (DDA) 1952 which is punishable under Section 39B(2 ) the same Act that provides for the death penalty.

He said the victim started making a digital currency exchange transfer of RM500 and then made subsequent transactions lured by the display on the platform which showed a profit of RM109,985.45. “Both victims realised that they had been scammed after they were informed that someone had filed a complaint against them (victims) for money laundering and they were required to withdraw all the profits. “They were told to first pay one per cent of the total profit, failing which the profit will be forfeited,” he added.

She was also accused of using her position by recommending another company, also related to her husband, to carry out the proposed ICT services for the works to improve the interim payment tracking system (IPAYS) Version 2.0 to Version 3.0′ at LLM, with a tender price of RM212,500. The accused is alleged to have committed both offences at Wisma Lebuhraya KM6, in Hulu Langat, on September 12, 2019 and April 24, 2020.

Lawyer, Wan Juhrah Muntek, who represented the two accused, appealed for a lower bail on the grounds that her clients had cooperated well throughout the investigation. Judge Awang Kerisnada Awang Mahmud set bail of RM35,000 for Norzuriati and RM20,000 for Syed Rosli, and allowed the additional conditions proposed by the prosecution, in addition to ordering both accused not to disturb or contact witnesses.

       "   'cf1:content': 'JOHOR BAHRU, Jan 24 — Three friends escaped the gallows after the High Court acquitted them today of two charges of drug trafficking and possession five years ago. Judicial Commissioner Noor Hayati Mat made the ruling after finding the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case against Muhamad Alqayyum Abdul Majid, 30, Nur Hasanah A. Latif, 26, and Mohamad Aizat Omar, 33, at the end of the prosecution case. “Therefore, the three accused are discharged and acquitted of the two charges without being called to enter a defence,” she said. Hayati said the prosecution failed to present evidence that the first accused (Muhamad Alqayyum) rented or lived in the third room in an apartment in Taman Cahaya, Kota Puteri, and failed to prove the man handled the drugs found, as there was no evidence of his fingerprints. “The prosecution failed to submit additional evidence, based on the defence’s suggestion that the plastic container containing drugs was not found on the floor in an open state but was found in the closet,” she said. The element of common intention was not proven, and the suggestion that the second accused (Nur Hasanah) was sleeping was confirmed by the raid leader, who was the second prosecution witness, although the sixth prosecution witness, who was the investigating officer, disagreed. On the third accused (Mohamad Aizat), Hayati said the fact that the third accused was not present during the raid and was not proven to stay permanently in the third room created a gap in the narrative of the prosecution’s case and the element of common intention also failed to be proven. Apart from that, the third room may be accessible to other people as several individuals are often in the house; besides, the issue of the access card not being seized from any of the accused raises questions about whether only they had access to the house. Deputy public prosecutor Siti Norliza Abdullah appeared for the prosecution, while lawyers Manian K. Marappan and Harpreet Kaur Gill represented Alqayyum, Nisrina Atirah Abd Razak represented Hasanah, and N. Mariappan represented Aizat. Six prosecution witnesses testified in the trial, which commenced on September 18 last year. The trio were charged together with distributing 204.76g of cannabis in the apartment at 2.35pm on September 17, 2019. The charge was framed under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which can be punished under Section 39(B) of the same law and read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code, which provides for death by hanging or life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the rattan, upon conviction. They were also accused of having in their possession 3.09g of ketamine and were charged under Section 12(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which is punishable under Section 12(3) of the same law, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of five years or a fine not exceeding RM100,000, or both if convicted. — Bernama ',\n",

The victim filed a report at Raub police station near here yesterday, after failing to contact the suspect to withdraw the promised ‘profits’. Yahaya advises the public to be cautious and check before participating in online investments, especially those that promise lucrative returns in a short period of time.

Lee Boon Han, 55, made the plea after the charges were read before trial judge Fadhli Mahmud. The court also ordered Lee to serve six months in jail if he failed to pay the fine. Lee paid the fine. According to the charge sheet, Lee was charged of constructing the resort in Pulau Perhentian using a conceptual drawing by an unqualified freelance designer, which could not be used for any construction project and lacked certification from an accredited consultant. He also did not obtain approval or planning permission from the Besut district council and did not carry out soil investigation at the construction site. Lee was said to have also failed to provide an environmental impact assessment report for the construction project and hired an “incompetent” site supervisor as well as unskilled workers who were not certified by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB). The charge sheet said a three-storey dining hall collapsed, crushing seven workers, resulting in the death of two workers, both Indonesian nationals, identified as Suparo and Fathul Munir, during the incident that happened between 1am and 5am. Lee committed the offence under Section 34B (1) (c)of the Malaysian Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) 1994 (Act 520) and read together with Section 34D (1) of the same Act, which is punishable by a fine of RM500,000 or jail term not exceeding two years or both. CIBD prosecutor Muhammad Hafidz Hassan said that the accused should be given a severe punishment as the incident was of public interest since the resort would be used by the public after its completion. In mitigation, Lee’s lawyer Hayder Yazid, requested that the sentence imposed on his client be reduced as his guilty plea had saved the court’s time and it was his first offence. He said Lee also took responsibility and paid for the treatment costs of the five injured workers and the repatriation expenses of Suparo and Fathul to Indonesia, amounting to RM44,300. — Bernama ',\n",

She was charged with not declaring her assets by deliberately giving a written statement under oath that did not comply with the terms of a notice, dated to November 8, 2023, sent to her by an officer from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) with the rank of Commissioner on November 1, 2023. The properties are Menara Ilham, two companies, namely Ilham Tower Sdn Bhd and Ilham Baru Sdn Bhd, two luxury cars, both Mercedes Benz, a house in Persiaran Bukit Tunku, four lots of land in Bukit Tunku, and one lot each in Penang and Taman Tun Dr Ismail.

In delivering the court’s decision on Lew and Chin’s appeal against their conviction, Justice Vazeer said there were overwhelming evidence to establish a case beyond reasonable doubt against Lew and Chin. He said the victim had positively identified the duo in a car which was used to abduct her and in the shophouse where she was held captive. The three men were sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court on March 9, 2020 after they were found guilty of abducting and wrongfully confining Lim Hoe, who was 63-years-old then, with intention to seek for RM2 million as ransom at Wei Ben Wellness & Health Care Sdn Bhd in Taman Sea Kelana Jaya, Selangor at about 6pm on November 10, 2015.

Bukit Aman Narcotics Crimes Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Kamaruddin Md Din said the syndicate was adulterating a type of juice with various drugs and distributing the beverage at Klang Valley entertainment outlets. Its investigations revealed the syndicate, operational since mid-2023, utilised luxury condominiums in Kajang and Cheras as their headquarters, and marketed the laced juice to entertainment outlets and private parties. “We discovered they mixed various types of drugs in juices and sold them between RM180 and RM300 per bottle depending on the size and drug content, catering to the customers’ demands. “Each syndicate member received about RM30,000 per month as wages for processing and distributing the drugs, making a lucrative profit from the sales,” he said during a press conference at the Cheras district police headquarters today. Kamaruddin said 54.55 litres of drug-laced juice, 1.68 kg of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) powder, 144 g of ketamine, 16 g of marijuana, five kg of ecstasy powder, 550 Eramin 5 pills, and 2,900 ecstasy pills estimated at RM448,850 were confiscated. Three luxury vehicles, cash, and jewellery, estimated at RM489,408, were also seized in the raids.

However, a three-member bench comprising Justice Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Azmi Ariffin, and High Court Judge Datuk Noordin Badaruddin, allowed his appeal for the 20 whipping sentence imposed on him by the Session Court to 10 strokes. In dismissing the 45-year-old’s appeal for a reduction of his jail sentence, Justice Vazeer said the 25-year jail term imposed for each charge was not manifestly excessive, taking into account the relationship between the appellant and the victim, who is his biological child. He said the victim should be taken care of by the father and not be subjected to rape. On August 19, 2022, the Sessions Court found the man guilty of two charges of committing incest with the girl at a house in Klang, Selangor, on April 8, 2019, and April 16, 2019, respectively, and sentenced him to 25 years jail and ten strokes of the rotan for each charge. The accused was ordered to serve the jail sentences consecutively. The man appealed, but the High Court dismissed it on March 6 last year. Meanwhile, the same panel also affirmed the 15 years jail sentence and one stroke of the cane imposed on a farmer for raping his daughter after ruling the jail sentence was not manifestly excessive. Justice Vazeer, in delivering the court’s decision, said the victim was still the man’s biological daughter, although she was born out of wedlock. On April 14, 2022, the 51-year-old man was sentenced to 15 years in jail and one stroke of the cane by the Sessions Court after he pleaded guilty to raping the girl in a room of a house in Pasir Puteh, Kelantan, on March 24, 2022. Unhappy with the jail sentence, he appealed to the High Court but was dismissed on February 9 last year. — Bernama ',\n",

The ministry’s Kuala Lumpur director Ariffin Samsudin said the suspects, aged between 35 and 57, were nabbed by a police team under Op Tiris 3.0. The operation led to the seizure of four five-tonne bonded lorries, two skid tanks with a capacity of 20,000 litres each, 40 intermediate bulk container (IBC) tanks, five suction pumps with hoses and 44,000 litres of diesel, with an estimated value about RM300,000. “A week’s police intelligence revealed that several bonded trucks were travelling to 20 petrol stations in the Ampang area, Selangor. They are believed to have been in operation since mid-December last year. “The affected petrol stations are being investigated as the same trucks have been making repeated purchases on a daily basis. Based on observations, the diesel purchased will be collected before being transferred to tankers arriving at the storage facility,” he told a press conference here today. Ariffin said the subsidised diesel bought by this syndicate is believed to be resold to factories and industries in Selangor and Negeri Sembilan at a lower price than the market price. He said the initial investigation revealed that the premises raided did not have licences or permits to trade in controlled goods, namely diesel. “The five men arrested were lorry drivers and workers at the storage facility. They were released on bail after their statements were taken,” he said. Ariffin emphasised that KPDN Kuala Lumpur did not rule out the possibility that it was a syndicated activity controlling certain areas. In another development, Ariffin said KPDN Kuala Lumpur has opened 10 investigation papers in 2023 with 15 arrests of locals under Ops Tiris and seized controlled items and other equipment, including vehicles, worth RM965,000. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Jan 17 — The Federal Court’s three-member panel today rejected an Indonesian man’s review application to commute his death sentence for killing his three young daughters, to life imprisonment. This is the first time the Federal Court dismissed an application to review the death sentence after the Revision of Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023 came into force last year. Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim, who chaired the panel, dismissed Junaidi Bambang’s application after ruling that the circumstances of the case did not warrant the court to exercise its discretion under the new amendment to the law to substitute the death sentence to life imprisonment. Also on the panel were Federal Court judges Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. Junaidi, 67, was found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court on April 28, 2005, for killing two-year-old Julaika, nine-year-old Julaiha, 11-year-old Juriyanti, at their house in Kampung Dusun Cini, in Pekan, Pahang, between 8pm on February 27, 2002 and 3.30pm the following day. The man lost his appeals at the Court of Appeal and Federal Court on April 12, 2010 and February 8, 2011, respectively. According to the facts of the case, Junaidi was not happy with his wife’s decision to bring two of their four daughters to live in Melaka and this caused a massive misunderstanding between them. Junaidi claimed that his sister-in-law, whom his wife and children stayed with while in Melaka, wanted to sell his daughters into prostitution. On the day of the incident, his wife returned to the family’s house and found that the front door was locked and that there was no response from her daughters when she called them. She then entered the house through the back door and saw Junaidi lying in the kitchen with froth coming from his mouth, while the three girls were found lying motionless in the living hall. Earlier today, Junaidi’s lawyer Selvi Sandrasegaram asked the court to commute the death sentence to life imprisonment of 35 years saying that her client is remorseful and hoped the court would give him a chance to reform himself. She said Junaidi has been in prison for 22 years. Deputy public prosecutor Mohd Amril Johari, however, urged the court to maintain the death sentence saying that the children were strangled with nylon ropes. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin meted out the sentence on the infant’s mother Nor Aisyah Mohd Yunus, 40, and her housemate Noor Aisyah Ibrahim, 37, after finding the defence failed to raise any reasonable doubt at the end of the defence case. “After examining the testimony of all the defence witnesses, including the two accused, the court found the two accused failed to provide an explanation as to how the victim got injured, while they admitted that the victim was in the house at the time of the incident. “Therefore, the court sentenced each accused to 35 years imprisonment, starting from the date of arrest on November 4, 2019,” said the judge. According to the charge sheet, the two women, who are civil servants, are jointly charged with the murder of the toddler at a house in Jalan P5A/5 Phase 5R4, Presint 5, Putrajaya, between the middle of September 2019 and November 4, 2019.

Somchit Charen, 37, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a three-member panel of the Court of Appeal led by Judge Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail today for killing Suriati Mat Saad, 29, who was also her colleague, at a house in Taman Semarak, Sungai Petani, Kedah between noon and 5.30pm on September 19, 2011. According to Somchit’s counsel K. Simon Murali, the prosecution had agreed for the murder charge against his client to be amended to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. He said his client agreed to the amendment and pleaded guilty to the amended charge. He said the panel, which includes judges Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S.M. Komathy, then quashed Somchit’s murder conviction and death sentence and convicted her on the amended charge. Murali said Somchit, a Malaysian of Thai origin, was ordered to serve the jail sentence from October 23, 2018. Somchit was found guilty and sentenced to death by the Alor Setar High Court on July 14, 2021 for the murder offence. In mitigating for a lighter jail sentence, Murali told the court that the death of Suriati arose from a sudden fight between her and Somchit. He said they were in a relationship and Somchit was in love with Suriati but the relationship turned sour when Suriati decided to get married to a man. He told the court that Somchit was traumatised by the incident and until today she was still grieving for her friend. He said in the altercation, both Somchit and Suriati suffered serious injuries. He also told the court that his client was arrested and held in remand in hospital for 14 days and was released unconditionally, adding that seven years later in 2018 she was wanted by the police. She surrendered and was subsequently charged in the Magistrate’s Court with murder on October 23, 2018. In his judgment, High Court judge Datuk Ghazali Cha identified the duo as “pasangan cinta sejenis’’. The judge also said evidence from a prosecution witness showed that the fight between Somchit and the deceased was likely due to jealousy when Somchit found out that Suriati was going to be engaged to be married to a man. Deputy public prosecutor P. Sarulatha appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

The Federal Court three-member bench led by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat, allowed A. Francis’ review application, under the Revision of the Sentence of Death and Imprisonment for Natural Life (Temporary Jurisdiction of the Federal Court) Act 2023. Tengku Maimun ordered the 52-year-old man to serve the sentence from August 26, 1994, the date of his arrest. Francis has been behind bars for 30 years. The two other judges were Federal Court judges, Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Nordin Hassan. Lawyer Abdul Rashid Ismail, representing the accused, appealed to the court to commute Francis’ death sentence to life imprisonment, saying that the case was not the rarest of the rare, as the murder was not an act of terrorism and only involved a single victim. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) How May Ling, who was assisted by DPP Ng Siew Wee, objected to the application, and urged the court to maintain the death sentence, saying that the offence was committed in a gruesome, violent and brutal manner. “The offence was premeditated and done with a motive to sacrifice an innocent life to obtain a human skull for the purpose of getting ‘nombor ekor’,” How said. Francis was found guilty and sentenced to death by the Temerloh High Court on October 21, 1996, for killing Bangladeshi Ali Ahammed Mohammed Ullah, at the Kim Swee Leong oil palm plantation in Jalan Kuala Lumpur-Kuantan-Mentakab, Temerloh district, Pahang, between 9 pm and 11.30 pm on August 19, 1994. He lost his appeals at the Court of Appeal and Federal Court, which were dismissed on Sept 18, 2002 and March 21, 2005, respectively. The facts of the case revealed that Francis committed the offence on the advice of a bomoh as part of a ritual. He used a rattan cane to clobber Ali Ahammed’s head until he was unconscious, before decapitating him. He then buried Ali Ahammed’s head in an oil palm plantation. Francis was one of the 17 prisoners, aged between 45 and 63, whose death sentences and natural life imprisonment sentences were commuted to jail sentences of between 30 and 35 years. Twelve prisoners, including three Indonesians — Fernandez, Mohd Nor Fauzi and Buhanuddin Bardan — Moh Chuan Pin, Mohamad Deraman, Ong Lock Soon, Johan Yeob Idris, M.Poobalan, K. Nanda Kumar, S. Satiaselan, Wan Bakri Wan Ahmad and Ranjit Sing a/l Jit Singh, applied to the court to commute the death sentences which were imposed on them, to custodial sentences. The other four — Nor Jumalis Abdullah@Khamis, Ku Izham Ku Adnan, Suhirman Maksom (Indonesian) and A. Gunabalan —filed the review applications to commute their natural life imprisonment sentences. Poobalan, Nanda Kumar, Fernandez, and Burhanuddin were each given 12 strokes of the rattan. These 17 prisoners were convicted by the courts for murder, drug trafficking and discharging firearms while committing robbery offences. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Narcotics Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Kamarudin Md Din said in a raid on a condominium in the capital last Friday, the police arrested a local man, a Hong Kong resident and a Mongolian woman aged between 25 and 48 years. In an operation on the same day, the Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau, according to him, arrested a 26-year-old local man and woman believed to be involved in drug trafficking activities on the island. “As a result of the raid, the police confiscated chemical powder weighing 74.03 kilogrammes (kg) and 7.41 kg of heroin base in Malaysia while 3.5 kg of heroin base was confiscated in Hong Kong with a total value estimated at RM7.89 million. “Also confiscated were equipment for drug packaging as well as molds for making statues and frog-shaped figurines. All the seized drugs can be used by a total of 399,169 people,” he said in a special press conference at the Kuala Lumpur police headquarters here today. Mohd Kamarudin said the modus operandi used by the syndicate was to turn the raided residential premises in the capital into a centre for packing the drugs before distributing them to the Hong Kong market. “The arrested suspect is believed to have hidden the chemical powder and heroin base involved in the statue he made himself before wrapping it and using a courier service to send it to Hong Kong. “When it arrives in Hong Kong, the chemical powder and heroin base involved are believed to be reprocessed to be made into heroin-type drugs for the market there,” he said. Preliminary screening tests by the police found that the Mongolian female suspect tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine while a criminal record check, found the local man had a criminal record under the Common Gambling Act 1953. “All the suspects were investigated in accordance with Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and were remanded for seven days from January 6 to 12 to assist investigation. “Police will continue to track down the remaining members of the syndicate to be brought to justice. It is hoped the people will channel information related to drug trafficking activities in their vicinity,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

A panel of three judges comprising Chief Judge of Malaya Tan Sri Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah, and Federal Court judges Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, held there was merit in You Poh Khoon’s appeal against the death sentence. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Zabidin set aside the death sentence imposed by the High Court and replaced it with a jail sentence. “The appellant should be given a chance to serve the jail term,” he said. Justice Zabidin ordered You to serve the jail sentence from the date of arrest, October 9, 2018, and also spared the man from whipping as he is over 50 years old. Earlier, You’s lawyer Amir Faliq Mohamad Jamil informed the court the Attorney-General’s Chambers had allowed his client’s representation for him (You) to withdraw his appeal against the conviction and for the death sentence to be substituted with a jail sentence. You, 58, was sentenced to death by the High Court on May 24, 2022, after he was found guilty of killing his 74-year-old father, You Su Kim, between 3pm on October 8, 2018, and 10.30am the following day in their house in Khatan Baru, Chemor, Ipoh, Perak. He lost his appeal at the Court of Appeal on March 6 last year. According to media reports, You killed his father by severing his head and chopping up his body after the deceased scolded him for consuming drugs at home. The victim’s head was buried in the backyard while the body parts were dumped in a 1.5m-deep sewage hole. In mitigation, Amir said his client was the only one among four siblings who took care of their cancer-stricken father, who became bedridden after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer three months earlier. His client’s family members were also hopeful that he would be spared the death sentence as they had already lost their father. Deputy public prosecutor How May Ling asked the court to impose between 30 to 40 years jail sentence, saying that forensic evidence showed slash wounds to the deceased’ neck, which was the cause of death, alongside 15 other injuries. The deceased’s hands and leg were also severed. You was placed under observation at Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta, Perak, for 22 days, and prosecution witness Dr Ian Lloyd Anthony testified during the trial that he was of sound mind at the time of the offence. — Bernama ',\n",

Based on the information, the syndicate used containers to smuggle drugs. On December 26, a man with the title “Datuk”, believed to be a leader of a drug syndicate, was among ten men arrested in Sabah for alleged involvement in the largest drug trafficking syndicate in the state.

The charge was framed under Section 4(1)(b) of the Sedition Act 1948 and is punishable under Section 4(1) of the same law, which provides a fine of not more than RM5,000 or a maximum of three years in jail or both if convicted. Deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Mustaffa Kunyalam offered RM10,000 bail with one surety. He also asked for a gag order to be imposed against Azri, to deter him from commenting about the case. In mitigation, lawyer Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali, representing the accused, pleaded for a lower bail of RM3,000, stating that his client cooperated well during the authorities’ investigation. “My client works online, besides looking after his wife, who is a housewife, and five school-going children.

According to him, the car was towed by a vehicle towing company without anyone having to enter the car. Mohammad Fakhrurrazi: “While responding to the suggestion from lawyer Datuk Ram Singh that you have contaminated a very important exhibit at the crime scene, can you explain why you disagreed?” Muhammad Amir Aiman: “I did not directly handle the case item I handed over to the investigating officer.” Mohammad Fakhrurrazi: “While responding to the suggestion from the lawyer (Erveana Ansari) that it is impossible for no one to be inside the car, as the handbrake needs to be released to tow the car, can you explain why you disagreed?” Muhammad Amir Aiman: “I do not agree (with Erveana’s suggestion) because I am not sure whether the handbrake was working or not at that time”. The police officer from the Tawau District Police Headquarters said this while testifying on the fourth day of the trial of the murder case of e-hailing driver Nurman Bakaratu, 61, involving eight accused, namely former Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) chief of staff (intelligence) Datuk Mat Zaki Md Zain, six police officers, and a civilian.

Mat Zaki, 59, is facing two charges of abetting in the murder of Nurman under Section 109 of the Penal Code, read together with Section 302 of the same code. Muhammad Amir Aiman also told the court that he disagreed with the suggestion from lawyer Mohamed Zairi Zainal Abidin that he was negligent when towing the car by not caring about what happened to the car and only focusing on towing the car from the crime scene to the Tawau District Police Headquarters. “I did not tamper with any evidence or items found in the vehicle,” said the 11th prosecution witness.

He said every vehicle the suspect stole was believed to have been smuggled into a neighbouring country. “The mastermind, Ah Ho, is believed to have received an order from a man in Thailand to steal a vehicle. Then, the vehicle will be left on the side of the road to be picked up by another man (believed to be hired by a man in Thailand), who will then be brought into that country. “Thus far, the suspect admitted to being involved in six cases of 4WD vehicle theft (four in Kuala Lumpur and two in Selangor) and receiving RM20,000 for each stolen vehicle,” Ahmad said during a press conference at the Sentul district police headquarters today. The police also seized two vehicles (believed to be a stolen car and a rental car), 26 sets of vehicle registration numbers and eight road taxes as well as other equipment believed to be used to steal vehicles. The suspect’s modus operandi was to target 4WD vehicles, like the Toyota Hilux, by placing a tracker on the vehicle. “The suspects will retrace the vehicles and the location where the vehicles were parked. In the evening, the suspects would turn off the alarm system using special tools and then steal the car. “The suspect also has the registration numbers of other 4WD vehicles to use on the stolen vehicles to avoid detection by the authorities,” he said. In another development, police arrested a 36-year-old man who was stealing goods from parked vehicles in Sentul on Saturday (December 30). Ahmad said the police also seized, among others, seven Touch N’ Go cards, a mobile phone, and cash. “The man, who works as a cook, would target vehicles parked on the roadside while travelling to work,” he said, adding the suspect admitted to being involved in six cases in Sentul and was remanded for four days. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-member bench comprising Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim and Federal Court judges Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais dismissed Mohd Ferdaus Suwardi’s appeal against his conviction and death sentence. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Abang Iskandar said the court maintained the death penalty imposed on Mohd Ferdaus by the lower courts in light of the gruesome manner in which the crime was committed, which was without any mercy. He said the court declined to invoke its discretion to substitute the death sentence on Ferdaus for a custodial sentence. Earlier, in dismissing Ferdaus’s appeal against his conviction, Justice Abang Iskandar said the lower courts were correct to find him guilty of killing the victims and that he failed to prove the balance of probability that he was legally insane when he committed the crime. Ferdaus, 37, was sentenced to death by the High Court on November 12, 2019, after he was found guilty of killing Syed Mohd Fazrul Syed Mohd Ridhuan, 23, and Wan Amir Hamzah Abu Hassan, 48, at a chicken processing factory in Jalan Bukit Kuda, Klang, Selangor between 6.30am and 9am on July 31, 2017. He lost his appeal at the Court of Appeal on May 26, 2022. According to the facts of the case, Ferdaus returned to his village after killing the two men and admitted to his mother what he had done. In his testimony, Ferdaus admitted to killing the two men, but on the defence of insanity under Section 84 of the Penal Code. However, the High Court judge, in considering the expert evidence of three psychiatrists, found that Ferdaus failed to prove the defence of insanity. In mitigation before the Federal Court today, lawyer Mohd Fadhly Yaacob asked the court to substitute the death sentence on his client to between 30 years and 33 years in jail, but deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee urged the court to maintain the death penalty. She said Ferdaus had attacked the deceased when they were asleep, and the attack was exceptionally cruel, adding that Syed Mohd Fazrul suffered 45 injuries while Wan Amir Hamzah had 23 injuries on his body. “He did not stop the attack when the deceased begged for mercy,” she said, adding that Mohd Ferdaus acted out of spite with vindictiveness, which warranted the most severe condemnation. — Bernama ',\n",

All the accused nodded after the charge was read out to them before Magistrate Nur Hafizah Rajuni, but no plea was recorded as the murder case is under the jurisdiction of the High Court. In the same court, Ganong Segaran and his brother, G. Dandem Bain, 30, pleaded not guilty to a charge of causing the disappearance of evidence of an offence to screen the offenders from legal punishment. They were jointly charged with committing the offence at the same location and date between 3.30pm and 8pm. The charge, framed under Section 201 of the Penal Code and read together with Section 34 of the same law, provided a prison sentence of up to seven years or a fine, if convicted. Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamad Nor Hakimi Mohamad Rosedin did not offer bail, but lawyer Erni Ahmad, from the National Legal Aid Foundation, requested bail for her client, Dandem Bain. Nur Hafizah then set bail at RM5,000 with one surety for Dandem Bain and ordered him to not intimidate witnesses. The court set March 4 for mention of both cases. — Bernama ',\n",

Kangar district police deputy chief Supt Baeyah Abdul Wahab said the arrest was made during a raid at her employer’s house at 2.20pm on December 30 based on information. This was after the police received a report from the public regarding the discovery of the body of a baby boy in the backyard of the house at 11.01 m on the same day. “Results from the initial investigation found the baby boy was buried at a depth of five inches, and the area was also open and unfenced. “The baby still had the umbilical cord attached and was wrapped in white cloth. The baby boy was buried behind the house next to her employer’s,” she told the press today. Based on the suspect’s interrogations, she is believed to have buried the baby boy when she realised the infant was lifeless after giving birth alone in her employer’s house. “The suspect gave birth to the baby on December 20 last year, at noon, and buried the baby the following day at 6.30am. Our investigation found that during the incident, her employer was in Kuala Lumpur,” Baeyah said. The employer was unaware that the woman was pregnant as she showed no physical signs of pregnancy after coming to work in Malaysia in May last year. She said the suspect has been remanded until January 5, and the case is being investigated under Section 318 of the Penal Code. Baeyah added the body of the baby boy was sent to Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital (HSB) in Alor Setar. — Bernama ',\n",

He allegedly allowed the foreigners to exit the country through the Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 (KLIA2) without taking legal action against them. Judge Rozina Ayob ordered Mohd Al-Ridhuan Ahmad Zaini, 38, to be freed after finding the prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case against him at the end of its case. “The prosecution failed to prove a prima facie case on the 17 main charges and three alternative charges (made against Al-Ridhuan). Therefore, the accused should be acquitted and discharged of all the charges without being called to defend himself,” she said in her judgment, released today. Rozina said there were many gaps in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, especially the evidence of two immigration officers, namely the 11th prosecution witness (SP11), Muhammad Hakim Hanafi, and Noorashikin Radzali (SP27), who is a suspected accomplice in the case. “There is no solid evidence regarding the task schedule of SP11 and SP27, which is said to be an important element to prove the validity of the fact that they received the payment on the instruction of the accused,” she said. Regarding the alternative charges, there was no evidence to show the passengers who were allowed to leave the KLIA2 international exit by SP11 and SP27 were foreigners who committed immigration offences. “The prosecution failed to prove the money received by SP11 and SP27 were payment to help foreigners who committed offences under the Immigration Act to leave Malaysia,” Rozina said. The case trial began in September 2021, with a total of 31 prosecution witnesses called to testify. According to the 17 charges, Al-Ridhuan was alleged to have accepted bribes amounting to RM21,500 from a woman as a reward for helping to allow foreigners who committed offences under the Immigration Act 1959/1963 (Act 155) to exit Malaysia through KLIA2 with no legal action taken against them. All the offences were allegedly committed at Jalan Tasik Utama 7, Medan Niaga Tasik Damai, between July 25 and November 11, 2020. The charges were framed under Section 16 (a) (A) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 (Act 694), which provides a maximum jail term of 20 years and a fine of five times the value of the offence committed or RM10, 000, or whichever is higher, upon conviction. On the three alternative charges, Al-Ridhuan was alleged to have paid Noorashikin and Muhammad Hakim to do the same, and the offence was allegedly committed at Kompleks Perbadanan Putrajaya and a premise in Taman Connaught, Cheras, on August 1 and August 2, 2020. The charges were framed under Section 25(3) of the MACC Act, which provides a maximum fine of RM10,000 or imprisonment for up to two years or both if convicted. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Syafeera Mohd Said meted out the sentence on Zakaria Kamaludin, 67, after finding the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubts on the case at the end of the defence case. She ordered Zakaria to serve the jail sentence from today and to undergo counselling throughout his imprisonment, as well as to be placed on a two-year probation supervision after completing his time. However, the court allowed a stay of execution of the sentence following an application by Zakaria’s lawyer, M. Thanakumaran, to appeal against the sentence considering his client’s health, but subject to the condition that appeal be filed within 14 days, failing which Zakaria would be sent to prison. The proceeding today was held at the Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital here as the accused was warded there earlier for breathing difficulties. Zakaria was charged under Section 14(a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 which is punishable by up to 20 years imprisonment, and also whipping, upon conviction. He was charged with committing the offence in a house in Meru near here at 5.40 pm on April 21, 2021. In mitigation, Thanakumaran appealed for a lighter sentence on the basis that his client is a senior citizen, has a heart condition, and his health is deteriorating. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Nur Ayuni Jamri requested a stiffer sentence due to the tender age of the victim, who was only eight at the time. “The accused’s act of physical sexual assault on the victim shows that he disregards the laws of the country and religious law which prohibit such acts. The accused also had no decency and compassion for this young victim, with a vast gap of 57 years between them. “I also ask the court to take into account the trauma suffered by the victim as a result of this disgusting and heinous act by the accused. It is a very serious offence and deserves a harsh punishment as a deterrent to the community not to commit similar offences, ” she said.

Deputy Inspector-General of Police Datuk Seri Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said all the suspects, aged between 36 and 48, were arrested yesterday under a special operation at 2.30am. The operation involved the Bukit Aman Narcotics Crime Investigation Department and the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESScom). “Under this operation, several raids were carried out simultaneously around Kota Kinabalu and the Sabah East Coast, involving the Tawau and Semporna districts. “The syndicate is believed to have been active in trafficking syabu since 2015,” he told a special press conference at Bukit Aman today. Ayob Khan said the police intelligence found that the syndicate is the biggest in Sabah and has an international and local distribution network. “The syndicate’s modus operandi is to obtain the supply of syabu from a neighbouring country to be smuggled into the market in Sabah, especially the East Coast of Sabah, in addition to the Philippines and Indonesia,” he said. The drugs are taken into Sabah using the services of drug mules through commercial airlines and sea cargo shipments. They are stored in Sabah before being distributed to the syndicate’s distributors and buyers in Indonesia and the Philippines. No drug was seized and assets confiscated as investigations are still ongoing. “In addition, preliminary investigations found the syndicate members owned various assets including luxury cars, bungalows, 12 businesses in tourism, construction, petrochemical, oil and gas and manufacturing sectors, as well as a chain of restaurants,” Ayob Khan said. The syndicate leader was also found to be the patron of a non-governmental organisation to mask the illegal activities. He added the same suspect had previously been charged under Section 3(1) of the Dangerous Drugs Act (Special Preventive Measures) 1986. “The other nine suspects played the roles of personal helpers, drug mules and transporters,” Ayob Khan said. The investigation is being carried out under Section 130V of the Penal Code and Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma). “The investigation under Sosma is to enable police to investigate the syndicate’s crime comprehensively,” he said. The case is also being investigated under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities (AMLATFPUAA) Act 2001. The police are also investigating the involvement of the syndicate in the smuggling of contraband and subsidised items to Indonesia and the Philippines. — Bernama ',\n",

The public is also urged to follow the Commercial Crime Investigation Department’s Facebook and TikTok accounts to obtain information about commercial crime modus operandi, like investment fraud. He urged the public to use the online service Semak Mule before making any payment and downloading the Whoscall app to reduce the risk of becoming a fraud victim. “For victims, contact the National Scam Response Centre at 997 immediately as an initial action to block the outflow of money from the suspect’s account,” Kumar said. — Bernama ',\n",

It is a a form of one-way communication. NSRC does not call up any individuals. Therefore, any calls claiming to be from NSRC is a scam.” Ramli said to optimise the effort to eradicate and prevent such online crimes, police are urging the victims involved to quickly call NSRC at 997 to report the incident. “Calls to report to NSRC should be made in less than 24 hours for a better chance of blocking the money transfer. “At the same time, police are advising the people not to panic or too trusting of claims made by unknown individuals.

He was charged with two counts of possessing heroin and monoacetylmorphine weighing 22.0 g and 76.61 g of methamphetamine in front of the Telemong Police Station in Bentong, Pahang, at 10.45pm on April 5, 2018. Syukran was charged under Section 12(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, punishable under Section 39A(2) of the same Act, which carries a penalty of life imprisonment or not less than five years and also subjected to not less than 10 strokes of the cane. The court ordered him to serve the prison sentence concurrently from the date of his arrest on April 5, 2018, while the caning sentence was to be carried out separately. On August 12, 2020, Syukran was sentenced to death by the Temerloh High Court after being found guilty of drug trafficking under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, and the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and sentence on August 29, 2022. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Datin Asmah Musa, who applied for the caning sentence to be carried out separately, said the sentence would send a deterrent message to offenders and prevent them from repeating the same offence in the future. — Bernama ',\n",

Sessions Court Judge Datuk Ahmad Zamzani Mohd Zain handed down the sentence on Hasbullah Ali Alias, 48, after finding the policeman guilty of the offence. “After listening to all the testimony of the prosecution and defence witnesses, the court found that the accused failed to raise reasonable doubt, as well as provide an explanation to break the presumption on the balance of probabilities,” he said.

The three-panel judge led by the Chief Judge of Malaya, Tan Sri Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah reached the unanimous verdict to allow the final appeal of Tarmizi Yaakob, 28, and review his death sentence under the Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Act 2023. “The prison sentence is effective from the date of arrest on Oct 25, 2015,” he said, presiding with Federal Court Judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. Mohamad Zabidin also struck out Tarmizi’s appeal against the conviction and sentence for rape after his lawyer Azizul Shariman Mat Yusoff informed the court that they were not proceeding with it, thereby retaining the 15 years imprisonment and three strokes of the cane which was imposed earlier. On March 26, 2019, the Georgetown High Court meted out the death sentence on Tarmizi, who is known as ‘Babun’, after he was found guilty of murdering a Form Five student at an apartment in Teluk Kumbar, Georgetown between 7.30 am and 7.30 pm on Oct 25, 2015. The High Court also sentenced him to 15 years in prison and three strokes of the cane for raping his lover at the same place and time. Both the sentences were upheld by the Court of Appeal on Dec 8, 2021 Earlier during the proceedings, Azizul Shariman said the defence had submitted a representation for review under the Abolition of Mandatory Death Penalty Act 2023 to the Attorney General’s Office on Aug 15. He said the AG’s Office had no objection against the review, which only involved the sentence and not the conviction, which was confirmed by Deputy Public Prosecutor Noorhisham Mohd Jaafar. In mitigation, Azizul Shariman appealed for a minimum prison sentence on the basis that his client was only 20 years old at the time and was suffering from mild mental retardation due to drug abuse and did not receive maternal love as his mother died when he was 15. Noorhisham submitted that the accused had used a knife and the autopsy report showed the victim sustained 18 bruises, cuts, and abrasions, therefore, the prosecution requested a prison term of not less than 35 years. —  Bernama ',\n",

During the proceedings before Judge Izralizam, deputy public prosecutor Izralina Abdullah requested bail be set at RM30,000 for each of the accused, should the court allow bail though the offence is unbailable. Lawyer S. Ravichandaran, representing Muhamad Haffiz, however requested bail of RM5,000, taking into consideration his client being a Grade 41 investigator with a monthly income of RM3,000, and has two children to support. Lawyer R. Vikraman, representing Mohd Fahmee, requested bail of RM4,000 on the grounds that his client, a Grade 44 officer earning RM4,500 monthly is a single father and has to pay RM2,000 monthly alimony to his ex-wife, adding that his client had been cooperative throughout the investigation and is not a flight risk. Meanwhile, during the proceedings before Judge Siti Aminah, Izralina requested bail of RM30,000 with a surety for Azwan, with the additional condition that he must report to the nearby police station. Vikraman representing Azwan, requested bail of RM4,500. Judge Izralizam later approved bail of RM12,000 with a surety each for Muhamad Haffiz and Mohd Fahmee, with the additional conditions that they report to the police station monthly, refrain from harassing witnesses and surrender their passports to the court until the case is concluded. Judge Siti Aminah approved bail of RM10,000 with a surety for Azwan, along with the condition that he must report to the nearby police station once a month. Both courts also set Feb 5, 2024, for next mention. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, —The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) has introduced an accelerated transfer process to facilitate the promotion of eligible ACE Market public listed companies (PLCs) to the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia. “The framework will take effect through amendments to the equity guidelines starting Jan 1, 2024,” the SC said in a statement. The framework is part of a slew of capital market measures introduced by the SC to improve stock market vibrancy and reduce market friction. Its chairman Datuk Seri Dr Awang Adek Hussin said the ACE Market has remained a significant source of financing within the Malaysian equity capital market, with 20 ACE Market listings raising RM1.26 billion through initial public offerings as of October 2023. “This accelerated transfer process will benefit sizeable, qualified ACE Market PLCs by accelerating the transfer to the Main Market for greater visibility and access to a larger pool of investors, including foreign and institutional investors,” he said in the same statement. Transferring to the Main Market, which is the prime market for established companies, demonstrates that the ACE Market PLCs have achieved the standards in terms of quality, size and operations. The SC said the newly simplified and accelerated transfer process should incentivise more companies listed on the ACE Market to make continuous efforts to improve their corporate values and achieve sustainable growth for shareholders. “Under the new accelerated transfer process, an ACE Market PLCs must, among others, have a daily market capitalisation of at least RM1 billion for the past six months, and meet the profit requirements for companies seeking listing on the Main Market,” it said.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Dec 12 — A former senior police officer walked out a free man today after the Court of Appeal acquitted and discharged him from eight money laundering charges involving a total sum of RM3.35 million. A three-member panel chaired by Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera made the decision after allowing 60-year-old deputy superintendent Mohd Ismail Syed Merah’s application to review another Court of Appeal’s verdict in March last year, which sentenced him to 10 years in jail and fined him RM42 million for all charges. Justice Vazeer, in a unanimous decision, said the court agreed with the Johor Bharu Sessions Court, which found the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt against Mohd Ismail. “Therefore, we set aside a High Court order and reinstate the Sessions Court ruling to acquit and discharge him (Ismail) from all charges,” said Justice Vazeer, who sat with Justices Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. Justice Vazeer also ordered the RM3.35 million seized be forfeited to the government as proceeds from illegal activities under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing, and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001. However, the forfeiture is subject to Section 55 of the anti-money laundering law which allows bona fide third parties to file claims for the money in the sessions court.. On December 2 last year, the Court of Appeal allowed Ismail’s application for leave to review his conviction under Rule 105 Court of Appeal Rules 1994 in seeking the court to rehear his appeal. On March 22, a different Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against his conviction and sentence and increased his jail sentence from four years to 10 years, ordereing him to pay a total fine of RM42 million in default 48 months’ jail after allowing the cross-appeal by the prosecution. Ismail faced five charges of using monies obtained from unlawful activities, involving RM10,143.37, RM40,000, RM6,283.09, RM993,716.91, and RM500,000, respectively, to buy and increase investments in Takafullife Insurance Protection Plan and Takafulink Plan registered under his daughter’s name, Nur Aqillah Mohd Ismail. He also faced two other charges of committing money laundering, involving RM499,620 and RM29,950, using a third-party account belonging to one Tan Kim Tee. Ismail allegedly committed the offences at the MAA Takaful Building, Jalan Tun Razak, Johor Bahru and in two bank premises, namely RHB and CIMB banks at Jalan Rahmat, near Batu Pahat, Johor, between September 4, 2014 and December 28, 2015. He faced the eighth charge of possessing RM1.27 million and 8,178,000 Indonesian rupiahs in his house, which were proceeds from unlawful activities. In 2019, Ismail was acquitted and discharged by the Johor Bahru Sessions Court of all the money laundering charges. However, in 2020, the High Court convicted him on all the charges and sentenced him to four years in jail for each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. Deputy public prosecutors Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar and Mohd Fairuz Johari appeared for the prosecution. Meanwhile, when met after the proceeding, Ismail’s counsel Datuk Wan Azmir Wan Majid said his client, who retired as a deputy superintendent in May, will be entitled to his pension, backdated salary, and allowances. — Bernama ',\n",

Section 90(4) of the Companies Act 2016, meanwhile, states that it is an offence to accumulate company preference shares without having a company constitution and which can be punished under Section 90(5) of the same act, which provides for a fine of up to RM500,000. Senior prosecuting officers Mohd Fairuz Othman and Mohd Iqbal Mohd Yusof handled the prosecution while the company and its director were represented by lawyers Muhammad Hasif Ghazali and Fithril Hakim Ab Jalil. “After considering the appeals and arguments of both parties, the judge set bail at RM3,000 for each charge in one surety,” the statement added. FGP Ventures and Khemlani posted bail on the same day. The SSM explained that offering preference shares to the public by a private company (Sdn Bhd) is an offence under the Companies Act 2016. “The SSM has taken the legal action as a form of reminder to the corporate community and the public that enforcement action will be taken if there is a violation of the laws regulated by the SSM. “This is to ensure that corporate governance and compliance with company laws are always practised by corporate citizens and the business community in Malaysia,” it said. — Bernama ',\n",

The victim was asked to download an online application called ‘Bain Online’ and start transferring money to begin the investment. “The victim started investing from Oct 25 to Nov 24 and made six transactions in bank accounts of four companies as investment but started feeling doubtful when the suspect kept giving various excuses when requested to draw out his investment,” he said. Feeling cheated, the victim lodged a police report at the Sibu Commercial Crimes Investigation Department.

However, Muniandy rejected the appeal of the appellant to set aside his conviction “The court is of the opinion that there is no reason to interfere with the findings of fact made by the Sessions Court judge, who found the accused guilty of the three charges he was facing, and the court has made a maximum assessment of the evidence presented throughout the trial. “The Sessions Court also considered the defence of the accused. However, the court found that the defence failed to refute the presumption under the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009,” he said. Muniandy also allowed the request of lawyer Khairul Anuar Kashim, who represented Muhammad Saiful Iskandar, for a stay of execution pending an appeal at the Court of Appeal. Previously, the appellant had paid a fine of RM45,000. On June 22, 2022, the Sessions Court sentenced Muhammad Saiful Iskandar to 55 months in prison and a fine of RM45,000, after finding that the defence failed to raise reasonable doubt at the end of the defence case. For all the charges, he was charged with corruptly receiving RM2,000 in each transaction, from one Mohd Nazim Ariff Nazir Ariff, which was transferred into his Maybank account, as an inducement to expedite the payment process for the contract to supply manpower and equipment to deliver fertiliser, from the Nafas warehouse at NPK Fertiliser Sdn Bhd Kedah and Agro-Tech NPK (M) Sdn Bhd to the Nafas warehouse in Sabah and Sarawak. All the offences were allegedly committed at Dataran Maybank branch, Level 1, Tower A, Dataran Maybank, No.1 Jalan Maarof, here between Dec 10, 2015, and Feb 26, 2016.

Abidin Abdullah’s appeal against his jail sentence was struck out by the three-member panel of judges led by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail. Justice Hadhariah, who sat with Justices Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, said Abidin’s conviction and jail sentence are affirmed. “A mature adult should be a good example to the young, especially students,” she said. Abidin, 50, was found guilty by the Sessions Court on Oct 11, 2021, on seven charges as a person who had a relationship of trust that is a teacher, of committing physical sexual assault on the 12-year-old boy in Shah Alam, Selangor between Sept 21, 2019 and Oct 5, the same year. The man was sentenced to 15 years’ jail and two strokes of the cane for each charge. He was ordered to serve the sentence concurrently from the date of his arrest on Oct 7, 2019, which means he will serve a prison term of 15 years and be given 14 strokes of the cane. The Sessions Court also ordered Abidin to undergo rehabilitation counselling for 10 years pursuant to Section 26 (1) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 as well as police supervision for three years after he completed the jail sentence. He lost his appeal which was dismissed by the High Court on Aug 12, last year. Lawyer Mohamad Zaidan Daud representing Abidin initially asked the court to reduce his client’s jail sentence. Justice Azman, however, said the court can make an order for the 15 years imprisonment term to run consecutively which means Abidin’s jail sentence would be increased as the offences committed by Abidin were separate transactions. After consulting his client, Mohamad Zaidan informed the court that his client wished to withdraw the request.

       "   'cf1:content': 'SHAH ALAM, Dec 7 — A former Information Technology employee was sentenced to 16 years in prison by the High Court here today, for causing the death of bank manager Syed Muhammad Danial Syed Shakir at the Kuala Lumpur-Seremban bound North-South Highway (PLUS) in a road rage incident four years ago. Judge Julia Ibrahim ordered the sentence on Yew Wei Liang, 45, to start from the date of his arrest on Aug 10, 2019. While delivering her verdict, Judge Julia said the court had taken into consideration the mitigating factors put forth, including Yew’s background and his cooperation during the investigation, and the victim’s family’s impact statement. “At the same time, the court has to emphasise the importance of public interest in such a case and mete out a deterrent sentence that will serve as a lesson to the public, because it started as a road rage case, being driven by anger and dissatisfaction and aggravated by the use of prohibited substances only invites bad consequences. “The court also weighed the impact statement from the victim’s family and this is indeed a great tragedy that has befallen and impacted all parties, either directly or indirectly,” she said. In mitigation, Yew’s lawyer Wee Choo Keong applied for a six-year jail sentence for his client on the basis that he did not intend to kill Syed Muhammad Danial, and that it was more of an unfortunate outcome in a road accident involving both parties. “The said accident was an unfortunate outcome which was brought about by the deceased. If the deceased had just driven away after the scuffle was dispersed by SP17 (prosecution witness), the deceased would still be alive today. “It would be manifestly unjust and unreasonable for this court to place the blame for the deceased’s death solely on the accused’s shoulders when it is crystal clear that there was no premeditation or intention to cause death on the part of the accused, but instead it was a mere unfortunate accident for both parties,” he said. He added that his client was supporting his wife and elderly parents, and as a result of his arrest and detention, his wife also suffered a miscarriage. However, Deputy Public Prosecutor Raja Zaizul Faridah Raja Zaharudin pressed for a stiffer sentence commensurate with the offence as there was a prevalence of such incidents in the country. “This case had a significant impact on society and news about it went viral at the time. A stiff sentence should be imposed on the accused to teach him a lesson and make him an example so that people do not make the same mistake. “The consequences of the accused’s failure to control his emotions should be a lesson to the public when faced with difficult situations on the road,” she said. On Tuesday, the court found Yew guilty of the culpable homicide of Syed Muhammad Danial after the prosecution proved the case against him beyond a reasonable doubt under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code, which is punishable by up to 30 years in prison and a fine. On July 20, Judge Julia ordered Yew to enter his defence on the charge of causing the death of Syed Muhammad Danial under Section 302 of the same Code, after the prosecution proved a prima facie case against him at the end of its case. On Aug 22, 2019, Yew was charged with the murder of Syed Muhammad Danial, 29, at Kilometre 293.6 of the PLUS Highway (Kuala Lumpur-Seremban) between 1 pm and 2pm on Aug 10, 2019. — Bernama ',\n",

To deceive the authorities, the bungalow, situated in an area which houses several other foreign consulate offices, had been posing as a consulate that was still in operation and was guarded by armed personnel while the consulate sign was still displayed. Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said 28 individuals were arrested, comprising 16 men and 12 women aged between 20 and 62. Speaking at a press conference today, he said those arrested comprised 13 local citizens, seven Chinese, and four each from Brunei Darussalam and South Korea. Ramli said the syndicate’s modus operandi was to offer investments with the concept of ‘money games’ that promised lucrative returns in a short period of time. The syndicate offered investments to local, Chinese, Brunei Darussalam, and South Korean investors. “Investments are offered through cryptocurrency starting from 155 USDT up to 31,000 USDT and a promised daily return of one to two per cent for 155 days,” he said. During the raid, police also seized various items, including 41 mobile phones, 13 passports and a Lexus car. “The amount of losses is still under investigation, while the owner of the bungalow has been identified and will be summonsed to provide a statement soon as he is currently abroad,” Ramli said.

A three-judge panel led by Chief Justice of Malaya Tan Sri Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah handed down the sentence against N. Sanderasegaran, 35, after allowing the prosecution’s appeal to reinstate the original charge against the man in accordance with Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder. “The court found there was merit in the appeal by the appellant (prosecution) and agreed with the prosecution’s argument that the Court of Appeal erred when amending the charge from Section 302 of the Penal Code to Section 304(a) of the Penal Code (causing death). “Therefore, we allow the prosecution’s appeal. However, we have the discretion to either impose the death penalty or imprisonment (between 30 and 40 years),” said Judge Zabidin, who ordered the respondent (Sanderasegaran) to serve the prison sentence from the date of arrest on February 28, 2016. Sitting with Judge Zabidin at today’s proceedings are Federal Court Judge Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Judge Datuk Nordin Hassan. Sanderasegaran was sentenced to death by the Ipoh High Court in Perak on October 2, 2018, for the murder of S. Durga Devi, 17, in a house in Kampung Batu Besi, Ladang Sengat, Simpang Pulai, between 11pm on February 27, 2016, and 6am the following day. However, on March 15 last year, the Court of Appeal substituted the mandatory death sentence with 20 years in prison for causing the woman’s death. Earlier, Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohd Fairuz Johar asked the court to impose the maximum prison sentence of 40 years, taking into account that the victim was a weak woman, and the autopsy report found 129 injuries on the victim’s body. “Based on the testimony of the pathologist, it is clear that the cause of death of the victim was due to head injuries,” he said. Lawyer Charan Singh, representing Sanderasegaran, requested a prison sentence of about 30 years as his client had no previous record. “My client was arrested on February 28, 2016, and he has been in jail since that date,” said Charan Singh, who lawyer Noor Farihah Arshad assisted. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 26 — Police are currently investigating death threats made against Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim that surfaced on social media since this morning. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Razarudin Husain, when contacted, said so far, one report has been received on the matter, adding that additional details on the case will be announced from time to time. Earlier today, a screenshot of a TikTok video went viral on social media, where a user offered RM5 million to anyone who would shoot dead the Prime Minister, ministers, and members of a political party. The video has since been removed. Razarudin said the case is being investigated under Sections 507 and 233 of the Penal Code. Meanwhile, Parti Keafilan Rakyar Youth (AMK) deputy chief Muhammad Kamil Abdul Munim said representatives from the wing’s Putrajaya division lodged a report on the video at the Putrajaya district police headquarters at 1.43pm today. The video uploaded on TikTok by account user Jaiadani89 contained threats against the Prime Minister, with an offer of RM5 million for anyone willing to kill him,” he said at a press conference at the PKR Annual National Congress at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre. Muhammad Kamil urged the police to conduct a thorough investigation and take stern action against the irresponsible individual, as it could potentially jeopardise the country’s security and harmony. He also expressed concern that if such incidents were left unchecked, more irresponsible individuals could freely make statements to incite the public to issue death threats, thereby cultivating extremist practices. — Bernama   ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 26 — The police are facing an increasingly challenging situation in their efforts to eradicate drug trafficking, following syndicates’ increasingly creative modus operandi to escape legal action. Of late, there have been several raids involving large drug seizures by the police, of drugs hidden in cars which were used as storage, parked on the side of the road. Bukit Aman Narcotics Criminal Investigation Department (NCID) director, Datuk Seri Mohd Kamarudin Md Din, in acknowledging that it is the latest trend of drug trafficking syndicates, said that it presented challenges to the investigating officers. Mohd Kamarudin said that the tactic was used to avoid any meeting between the syndicate, ‘transporters’ and drug buyers. “If these drug buyers and transporters are arrested, they cannot provide information about the syndicate in detail, because they do not know each other, because there was no face-to-face meeting.” According to Mohd Kamarudin, it has caused the investigation to be complicated and challenging, due to the element of drug ownership, which is difficult to prove, as in most cases the owner of the vehicle is someone else, whether it is a rented or abandoned car, and does not belong to the individual arrested. In the meantime, the speed of digital technology also allows users to buy drugs online without seeing each other, because of drug delivery and then using a courier service. Mohd Kamarudin said that there are several websites on rhe dark web, which have been identified as carrying out drug buying and selling activities openly online. “Police will continue to carry out intelligence from time to time, to ensure that distribution activities through the dark web do not develop more widely,” he said. Meanwhile, NCID, according to Mohd Kamarudin, has successfully seized 19,147.56 kilogrammes of various types of drugs, and 13,913.44 litres of various types of liquid drugs, to combat drug distribution and abuse for 10 months this year. Also seized were 64,870.73 kg of ketum leaves and 49,013.56 litres of ketum water. The total value of the seizures was RM452.40 million. Mohd Kamarudin said that NCID always tries to find a solution to ensure that criminals are punished according to the existing laws. — Bernama ',\n",

Priscilla Hemamalini. “I plead not guilty, and I am ready to go on trial,” he said. Razali was charged with making insulting remarks by stating decisions of the Judiciary were being controlled by the government at Padang Astaka Chukai, Kemaman in Terengganu between 9.30pm and 11.30pm on November 10. The charge, under Section 4(1)(b) of the Sedition Act 1948 and punishable under Section 4(1) of the same act, provides for a maximum fine of RM5,000 or imprisonment of up to three years, or both, upon conviction. Judge Priscilla Hemamalini allowed bail of RM6,000 in one surety and set additional conditions for the accused to refrain from making any comment or posting about the case until it is settled. The court fixed December 8 for mention. State prosecution director Datin Kalmizah Salleh offered RM10,000 bail with one surety along with the additional condition. Razali’s lawyer Hasshahari Johari Mawi asked for a minimum bail of RM1,000 and did not object to additional conditions but asked for it to be extended to the public so that there would be no discussion about the case’s merits outside the court. “My client is a member of the Senate, Terengganu state executive councillor and Kijal state assemblyman. He also has responsibilities to the people of Terengganu and Malaysia, as well as his wife, who suffers from heart disease. “He has given his cooperation during the investigation to the authorities and came to the court today to face this charge, without being forced,” he said. Previously, the media reported that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission lodged a police report regarding an inaccurate TikTok app post which could affect public confidence in the country’s law enforcement and legal system.

Last month, MACC revealed that the commission was conducting a probe into an NGO that collects donations for the Palestinian people, following doubts raised by many stakeholders on how the funds collected were spent. Following that, Perlis Mufti Datuk Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin, through a letter dated Aug 24, had instructed the Perlis State Islamic Religious Affairs Department (JAIPs) not to permit the collection of funds by Aman Palestin in places of worship and relevant religious premises within the state. — Bernama ',\n",

She said the drugs were indeed found in the bedroom occupied by the two appellants and that their version of the drugs belonging to two other persons was unreasonable.

Justice Hadhariah also ordered Lim and Lee to serve the sentences concurrently, meaning they will serve 30 years in jail. Lim was spared the rotan as he is over 50 years old. The other judges presiding on the bench were Justices Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. Lim, 63 and Lee, 31, were sentenced to death by the Penang High Court on September 27 last year for trafficking 77.9 g of heroin and monoacetylmorphine and 1517.3 g of methamphetamine in an apartment in Persiaran Bayan Indah, Bayan Lepas, Penang at 3.20am on November 1, 2018. Lawyer P. Latsmanan and Hussaini Abdul Rashid, representing Lim and Lee respectively, submitted that the drugs belonged to two other individuals who were also arrested by police for drug offences. Latsmanan said the two individuals stayed at the rented apartment a few days before the appellants moved in. He said the couple were not husband and wife but lived together.

Abdul Fattah Yassin, 64, said while other senior citizens are enjoying their twilight years with their families, he has to continue slogging to make a living for himself and his family. Abdul Fattah, who runs a Geomatics consultant firm, said he and his wife invested RM960,000 and RM360,000 respectively, into the company in mid-2019, using the firm’s working capital, pension funds, and savings. The father of two said he and his wife received only three months of dividends, after which they realised it was a scam when the company closed its operations and became uncontactable. “I was misled when I failed to research this investment company.  I trusted them after seeing their Securities Commission Malaysia registration documents. “I also knew the investment agent well, he is a former bank officer. He also invested in the company and both of us were deceived.  I am terribly disappointed with what happened, this matter must be taken seriously by the authorities,” he said. He was speaking to reporters after handing over an application requesting a status report on the investigation involving nearly 400 victims of an in-person fraudulent investment scheme worth over RM140 million at the Bukit Aman Commercial Crimes Investigation Department (JSJK), Menara KPJ, here today. The current status report under Section 107A of the Criminal Procedure Code on the investment scheme was handed over by Malaysian International Humanitarian Organisation Secretary-General, Datuk Hishamuddin Hashim to JSJK’s Electronic Card Investigation Unit Head, Supt Nooranita Ismail. Meanwhile, another victim, former civil servant Harun Mohd Yunos, 63, said he and his wife lost RM500,000 after investing in the same company in October 2022 under the influence of friends. “We each put in RM250,000 of our pension funds.  We received dividends for the first six months and then the company just vanished,” he said. JSJK Director, Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf verified that the department has received the application requesting a status report and that the investigations are ongoing. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 20 — The police, Commercial Crime Investigation Department, investigated an average of 15 non-existent investment cases daily from January until October this year. Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said they opened 4,435 investigation papers on non-existent investment cases involving losses amounting to RM364,537,421 during that period. “What is concerning is that the value of losses is equivalent to 20 per cent of the total loss value of commercial crime cases, which is RM1,824,715,080 recorded this year (until October),” he told a special media conference here today. He said that of the 4,435 non-investment cases investigated from January to October, a total of 4,051 cases involved online investment while 384 cases involved face-to-face investment. Ramli said that among the non-existent investment cases identified were schemes offering profits of up to 51 times within a period of three to six hours after the investments were made. He said investigations found that the syndicates began operating in October last year through Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram and TikTok by offering investments in shares, digital currency and grants using the name of the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) with five packages from as low as RM300 to RM2,000. “So far, police have received 28 police reports nationwide, with total losses of RM1,242,839.34 related to this scam. The cases are being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code,” he said. Ramli said MIDA had issued a warning on Nov 9 last year about investment fraud using the agency’s name on their Facebook page. In addition, he said police have also traced the investment scheme known as CCF Trade and EXGCOO 2023, with 41 cases being investigated involving losses of RM8.05 million. “The investment schemes offered are based on the buying and selling of shares in Malaysia foreign markets like the United States and Hong Kong, with interested investors told to download applications for them to view their accounts generating profits, but which cannot be withdrawn,” he said. Ramli said investigations found that the victims involved in these fraud cases are aged between 29 and 79 and come from various employment backgrounds, with a majority of them being retirees and businessmen. Meanwhile, police have arrested four men aged between 37 and 63, who acted as company directors and individuals looking for mule account holders on suspicion of being involved in the Yomaex investment fraud syndicate. “So far, 45 individuals have been detained and 85 investigation papers opened, involving losses amounting to RM55,795,343.48,” he said. Ramli said they are still trying to trace the existence of love investment scams using almost the same modus operandi as love scams. Although the syndicate does not ask for money directly from their victims but would ask as a mentor to teach their victims about the investment methods. “Once they gain the victims’ trust, the syndicate will then ask them for money. So far, we know there are victims involved in love investment scams but there are some who do not want to come forward to lodge reports.” In addition, Ramli said police have also identified a trend of company registration and opening of bank accounts in the company’s name to be used as a mule account to enable financial transactions to be carried out more frequently and involving larger amounts. “So far, police have traced a total of 86 companies and 70 businesses registered for such purposes and, as a preventive measure, police proposes that procedures and conditions for the registration of companies and business be refined and tightened.” — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Anselm Charles Fernandis imposed the sentence on Hairudin Ngadiron, 48, and also increased the fine from RM341,000 to RM2.341 million. The court handed down prison sentences ranging from four years to seven years and six months for the charges, making the total prison sentence 37 years. However, the court ordered all the sentences to run concurrently beginning today, whereby the appellant would only have to serve a prison sentence of seven years and six months, and he would be imprisoned for another seven years if he failed to pay the fine. Judge Anselm made the judgment after rejecting Hairudin’s appeal against the conviction and prison sentence amounting to 14 years and a RM341,000 fine handed down by the Melaka Sessions Court on October 23, 2020. In his decision, the judge also set aside the order of acquittal by the same Sessions Court against the first and second charges faced by Hairudin after allowing the prosecution’s appeal and sentenced him to seven years and six months in prison and a RM1 million fine for each charge. For the third charge, the court imposed a prison sentence of six years and a RM145,000 fine, while for the fourth to sixth charges, the appellant was sentenced to four years in prison each and fined RM149,000. The court also upheld the four-year prison sentence and a RM47,000 fine for the seventh and eighth charges, considering that the sentence handed down by the Melaka Sessions Court was sufficient. Judge Anselm granted the appellant’s request to stay the prison sentence and fine pending an appeal in the Court of Appeal. According to all the charges, Hairudin was accused of corruptly accepting bribes in the form of cash and home repair items such as roofing iron, eaves, porch wood, tiles, and house doors, as well as vehicle repairs amounting to RM465,886.32 from January to April 2017. The bribe was received from an individual as an inducement to receive orders to carry out works at Bakri PDRM Technical College, Muar, namely the repair of the building and security fence at the guardhouse, the repair work of the 25-metre semi-indoor target range, and the operation and maintenance services of the swimming pool and diving pool in the school’s sports complex in 2016. He allegedly committed all the offences at a house in Kampung Parit Gantung, Sungai Rambai Melaka, Jasin, Melaka, and a vehicle workshop in Parit Keroma, Muar, Johor. The charges were framed under Section 16(a)(A) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009, which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the amount of the bribe, or RM10,000, whichever is higher.

Sharnaaz, who wore a black shirt and black pants, appeared calm throughout the proceedings. Earlier, Wan Azmir said a representation was sent to the prosecution on May 2, and the defence received an answer through a reply letter that the prosecution wanted to withdraw the charge against the actor. DPP Nadia Eleena, who confirmed the matter, said she received instructions from the Attorney General’s Chambers for the case to be granted a discharge not amounting to acquittal (DNAA). However, Wan Azmir said he had requested his client be given a discharge and acquittal (DNA) because the complainant himself had withdrawn the case. “A police report was lodged by the complainant on the case withdrawal. Therefore, I request that a DNA be granted to Sharnaaz,” said Wan Azmir, who handled the case with Sharnaaz’s other lawyer, Datuk Abu Bakar Isa Ramat. On January 18, Sharnaaz pleaded not guilty to voluntarily causing injury to Izzul Islam Awang, 27, at the entrance of a condominium block in Jalan Dutamas at 8.30pm on June 16, 2022. The Bukan Kerana Aku Tak Cinta drama series actor was charged under Section 323 of the Penal Code, which provides for a prison sentence of up to one year or a maximum fine of RM2,000 or both if convicted. Meanwhile, Sharnaaz, when met by reporters after the proceedings, said he was thankful and happy with the decision today. “Alhamdulillah…even though it took a long time, I am grateful and relieved because I am finally free,” he said, adding it is important to clear his reputation for the sake of his acting career. — Bernama   ',\n",

Judge Datin Sabariah Othman made the decision after finding the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case against Semenyih Jaya Sdn Bhd director Lau Kok Loon, 80, at the end of the prosecution case. “After examining the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and the documents presented, the court found the elements of breach of trust failed to be proven, where the evidence presented failed to show that the accused committed breach of trust of the four cheques (RM7,608,167.43) that were entrusted to him. “Overall, the elements of the offence failed to be proven.

In her judgment, Judge Sabariah said the case investigation was incomplete, and many important pieces of information were not investigated, causing the accused to be denied his right to a fair trial. “The money was deposited into the account of the accused and another nominee, Lau Toon Lai. The failure to call this nominee resulted in some vital evidence not being firmly proven. “The court also agreed with the lawyer’s argument that the charges presented were flawed and invalid,” she added.

The appeal hearing was supposed to be heard before a panel of three judges comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. However, lawyer M. Manoharan requested a short adjournment to prepare the case as he was only appointed by the court to represent Dinishwaran on October 31 this year and had yet to see the records of appeal. Manoharan told the court that although he had been given the link to the records of appeal, he needed the hard copy as he was not well-versed in downloading the documents. He also said the records of appeal were voluminous. Kunaseegaran’s counsel Datuk N. Sivananthan told the court the lawyers and himself representing the other appellants did not object to the adjournment. Justice Hadhariah then set three days, December 4, December 7, and December 14, to hear the appeals. “Nobody is allowed to send (any) letter for adjournment. This is a final hearing date, no adjournment is allowed,” she said. Meanwhile, lawyer Afifuddin Ahmad Hafifi, representing M. Vishwanath, asked the court if he could make his submissions on December 14 as he would be away on December 4 and December 7. Lawyers Burhanudeen Abdul Wahid, Kitson Foong, and Amer Hamzah Arshad represented Thinesh Kumar, Ravi Chandaran, and Nimalan, respectively.

His body was found in an oil drum filled with cement at Persiaran Subang Mewah, Subang Jaya, on September 16, 2015. High Court judge Datuk Azman Abdullah (now Court of Appeal Judge), in his decision, held that all the six men had a common intention to kill Morais.

Of those arrested, 38 were business owners, company directors, and company secretaries, while the rest included bank officers and agents scouting for mule account holders. “This operation was conducted after police received 76 reports from victims of investment schemes, which involved losses totalling RM50,620,880.29. “The victims, aged between 22 and 81, are mostly retirees and businessmen,” he said during a special media conference today. The syndicate’s modus operandi was to offer cryptocurrency investments giving high returns in a short period. “Investors are given access to monitor the cryptocurrency transaction activities in the accounts registered under the investors’ names, but the money cannot be taken out,” Ramli said. Through the operation, the police also detected a new trend by the syndicate, utilising registered companies and businesses as mule accounts. “So far, we have traced 73 bank accounts used by the syndicate, involving 51 companies. We believe these companies and businesses were registered simply for carrying out the scam,” he said. The syndicate would approach individuals facing financial problems or homeless people to use their names for the setting up of companies and then open a company account. “These individuals will be given a one-off payment or monthly payment.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Nov 3 — The former chief executive officer of TH Heavy Engineering Bhd was imprisoned today, beginning a five-year sentence after the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction on three counts of criminal breach of trust (CBT) and two counts of money laundering totalling RM1.57 million. Datuk Nor Badli Munawir Mohamad Alias Lafti’s appeal against his conviction was dismissed by the three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. Nor Badli, 57, on a RM600,000 bail pending disposal of his appeal, was ordered to begin his jail sentence today. However, he was spared the rotan as he is aged 50 and above. TH Heavy Engineering was formerly a Tabung Haji associate company. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Vazeer maintained the five-year imprisonment imposed on Nor Badli by the High Court for the CBT charges and the three-year jail for the money laundering charges. He ordered the sentences to run concurrently, which means Nor Badli will have to serve only five years in jail. In upholding the conviction, Justice Vazeer said both the Sessions Court and High Court did not make any perverse finding which warranted appellate intervention for those charges. However, he acquitted and discharged Nor Badli on two CBT charges and two money-laundering charges. The accused was initially charged with five counts of committing CBT and five counts of money laundering. He was acquitted of one money laundering charge and convicted of the other nine charges. The prosecution did not appeal against his acquittal. On September 30, 2019, the Sessions Court sentenced Nor Badli to seven years in jail for each of the five CBT charges to run concurrently and four years in jail for each of the four money-laundering charges, also to run concurrently. He was ordered to serve the four-year jail term after completing the seven-year sentence. On November 2, 2021, the High Court dismissed Nor Badli’s appeal on his conviction but allowed his appeal to reduce the jail sentence. His jail sentence for each of the CBT charges was reduced to five years to run concurrently, and for the money-laundering charges, the court reduced the jail term to three years’ imprisonment for each charge, also to run concurrently. He was ordered to serve the three-year jail sentence after completing his five-year jail term for the CBT offence. This means Nor Badli had to serve eight years in jail. According to the charge sheet for the three CBT charges, the accused committed the offence involving cheques for RM400,000, RM570,000 and RM600,000 at the office of THHE Fabricators Sdn Bhd in Menara UOA in Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, in April, June, and September 2013. Concerning the money-laundering charges, Nor Badli was convicted of receiving RM570,000 in proceeds from unlawful activities from Bicara Sepakat Sdn Bhd director Murhasmee Mukhtar at Old Town White Coffee in Ara Damansara, Petaling Jaya, on June 26, 2013. He was also convicted of receiving another RM600,000 in unlawful activity proceeds from Murhasmee at the same restaurant on September 11, 2013. The accused was acquitted of the two CBT charges involving cheques for RM430,000 and RM575,800 at THHE Fabricators office in June and October 2013. The court also acquitted him of two charges of receiving RM430,000 and RM570,000 in proceeds of unlawful activities from Coral Intoil director Mohd Razip Mohammad and RL Offshore Sdn Bhd director Hanaffi Daud, respectively. Nor Badli was accused of committing the offences at THHE Fabricators and the Leaf Dining restaurant at Solaris Mont Kiara on June 27, 2013, and November 1, 2013, respectively. The accused was represented by lawyers Kitson Foong, Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Datuk K. Kumaraendran, Chew Jee San, and Vam Shir Mooi, while deputy public prosecutors Nahra Dollah, Parveen Hamedah Natchiar, and Aida Khairuleen Azli appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Wilayah Satu PPM deputy commander Supt Rohizan Mohamad said the team carried out investigations and surveillance for over a month before initiating Op Taring Landai to raid a premise at the Bukit Kayu Hitam Industrial area at 7.30am. “During the raid, we detained six men, including two Thai nationals. Two were drivers of two tankers that were from Thailand. Three others detained were locals who were also lorry drivers, while the sixth suspect was the caretaker of the premises. “Investigations revealed the premises were used as a store for subsidised diesel sourced from local stations using lorries and later transferring the diesel into tanker lorries from Thailand to be smuggled into the neighbouring country. “Police also found pumps, hose pipes, and pump nozzles believed to have been used to transfer subsidised diesel,” he said during a press conference today. During the raid, 131,040 litres of subsidised diesel worth RM543,816 was seized from four tankers, two of which were from Thailand, while the four lorries are estimated to be worth RM160,000 each. Rohizan said initial investigations revealed the syndicate had been actively involved in smuggling subsidised diesel for the past four months and able to rake in hundreds of thousands from the illegal activity. Its modus operandi was to use bounded lorries to buy subsidised diesel in Kedah and Perlis to be stored at the premises hidden from public view, before transferring the diesel to lorries from Thailand. The suspects, aged between 23 and 60, were later handed to the investigating officer from the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Cost of Living for further action. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'JOHOR BAHRU, Nov 1 — A single mother and her female friend were today jailed seven years each for ill-treating and neglecting her seven-year-old son and causing him to suffer injuries. Sessions Court Judge VM Mabel Sheela meted out the sentence on Nurul Asyiqin Mohamad Zahid, 27, and her housemate Awiin Chua, 30, after they pleaded guilty to two charges of child abuse on Aug 16. The court sentenced them to seven years’ jail on each charge and ordered them to serve the sentences concurrently from the date of their arrest on Aug 12. In her decision, Judge Mabel Sheela emphasised that such an incident should not have occurred, as the bond between a mother and her child is extraordinarily special. “If you (victim’s mother) ask your child to follow you, he will definitely do it even if it means enduring pain. “The court could not imagine the condition the victim would be in if this situation had continued, and we’re fortunate that the public intervened. Otherwise, the victim could have died.” Deputy public prosecutor Nur Diyana Zubir asked for a deterrent sentence, saying the victim had suffered more than 20 physical injuries and had been frequently abused. “In this case, we must commend the victim’s neighbours for their vigilance, which ultimately saved the victim. It is a case of public interest which has also attracted the attention of the consort of Johor Crown Prince, Che’ Puan Besar Khaleeda Bustamam,” she said. In mitigation, lawyer Nur Hazneena Zureen Jaesleen Mohd Hanafiah, representing the two accused, appealed for a lighter sentence, considering it was their first offence and they deeply regretted their actions. The two women committed the offences in a house on Jalan Wau Kikik 7, Bandar Layang Kasa, Pasir Gudang between July 1 and Aug 9 this year. They were charged under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum fine of RM50,000 or imprisonment of not more than 20 years, or both, on conviction. — Beenama ',\n",

The trial judge’s failure to amend the offence prejudiced the three appellants, which should be corrected by the appeal court to ensure no injustice is done to them (appellants). “Accordingly, this court allows the appeal of the three appellants to set aside Section 302 of the Penal Code and replace the conviction under Section 304 (a) of the Penal Code,” said Azmi. Deputy Public Prosecutor Fuad Aziz prosecuted, while lawyer Gurubachan S. Johal represented Davendran. Neelamegan and Hurisudhan were represented by lawyers Datuk Rajpal Singh and Amer Hamzah Arshad, respectively The three men were sentenced to death by the Kuala Lumpur High Court on October 15, 2021, for causing the death of a 58-year-old man under the Perumahan Awam Rakyat Wangsa Maju block at 8pm on April 18, 2018. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Oct 26 — The Federal Court today acquitted and discharged three friends, including one woman, on the charge of murdering a man whose body has yet to be found. A three-judge panel chaired by Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat ordered the release of Mohd Zulhiami Md Darus, 37, Siti Nor Asiah Abdul Wahab, 32, and Muhammad Rahmat Nazarudin, 29, after allowing their appeal against a decision by the Shah Alam High Court on October 24, 2019, in sentencing them to death for the murder. In the summary judgment, Tengku Maimum said the appellants raised several issues, and the court found the main issue was whether the appellants were denied the right to a fair trial. “After hearing the lawyers’ submissions for the appellants and the prosecutor, as well as examining the grounds of the judgment and the appeal record, we are satisfied the entire trial was conducted in a manner which did not comply with the law. “This prejudiced the appellants and resulted in their unsafe conviction. Therefore, we allow the appeal by the three. The order of the High Court judge, confirmed by the Court of Appeal, is set aside, and the three appellants are acquitted and discharged (of the murder charge),” said the judge, who sat with Chief Judge of Malaya Tan Sri Mohamad Zabidin Mohd Diah and Judge Datuk Abu Bakar Jais. After the court gave the decision, Mohd Zulhiami and Muhammad Rahmat were seen hugging each other, while Siti Nor Asiah was in tears. The three friends were appealing against the decision of the Court of Appeal on April 14, 2022, which upheld the conviction and death sentence meted out by the Shah Alam High Court on October 24, 2019. Mohd Zulhiami and Siti Nor Asiah were initially charged under Section 109 of the Penal Code with conspiring with Muhammad Rahmat to kill Mohammad Fairul Haqiemi, 21, at an apartment along Jalan Dato Yusof Shahbudin 3 Taman Sentosa, Klang, between 12.30am and 1am on August 29, 2016. Muhammad Rahmat was charged with killing Mohammad Fairul Haqiemie at 4am at the same location and under Section 302 of the Penal Code. However, the charge was amended at the end of the prosecution case with the time of the incident for the charge of murder and conspiracy to murder at 4am and the date changed to August 30, 2016. Earlier, lawyer Kitson Foong, representing Mohd Zulhiami, submitted that the defence only found out about the amendment of the date and time of the incident in the charge after examining the appeal records. “The High Court’s trial judge made the amendment after allowing the prosecution’s application without any notification. The lawyers were not informed of the amendment, and the three accused also did not know about it. “If an amendment is made, the charge should be reread to the client, and the plea should be recorded, and they can call witnesses for the defence,” he said. Lawyer Datuk Geethan Ram Vincent, representing Siti Nor Asiah, said the trial judge (High Court) had erred in terms of facts and law when he failed to consider the prosecution’s main witness, Zairul Noraidi Shahidin, was an accomplice, The matter was acknowledged by Muhammad Rahmat’s lawyer, Fahri Azzat. Deputy public prosecutors Parvin Hameedah Mohd Khaja and Aida Khairuleen Azli appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Rohaida Ishak ordered the man, Mohamad Saidi Che Omar, 31, to serve the jail sentence from the date of his arrest and to serve another five months if he failed to pay the fine after he pleaded guilty to the charge. Mohamad Saidi was charged under Section 307 of the Penal Code with attempting to murder the policeman, Reymee Abdul Rahman, 38, by using an axe to slash the victim on his arms and head at an oil palm estate in Felda Bersia, Gerik at about 11.30 am, on Oct 17. Based on the facts of the case, Reymee and his partner had gone to the estate for an anti-drug operation dubbed Ops Tapis. When they stopped Mohamad Saidi for inspection, the man started attacking them using an axe in one hand and a machete in the other hand, injuring Raymee on the head and arms. In defence, Raymee fired two shots which hit Mohamad Saidi on the knee. Once apprehended and searched, packets of methamphetamine and ganja were found in the man’s pockets. — Bernama   TAGS:x   Wednesday, 25 October 2023 ',\n",

Lawyer Amer Hamzah Arshad, representing Wong Ping Kiong, 60, and Tai Boon Wee, 63, said Judge Datuk Azhar Abdul Hamid ordered both his clients to be freed after allowing their applications to set aside the charges made against them. Deputy public prosecutor Law Chin How confirmed the matter. Based on the notice of motion, Wong and Tai filed the applications to set aside the charges under Section 18 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission 2009 because they could not be said to ‘intend’ to deceive or mislead Grant Thornton if the documents referred to had nothing to do with the company. On January 13 this year, Wong pleaded not guilty to four counts of submitting false documents to Grant Thornton Malaysia PLT over a non-existent sale of used machines totalling nearly RM3 million. According to the first charge, she allegedly submitted the GIIB Rubber Debit Note document dated December 30, 2019, amounting to RM2.95 million to Grant Thornton Malaysia’s audit manager Tam Siew Ping, containing false information regarding the sale of six units of used machines that did not take place which was intended to deceive the company. For the second to fourth charges, Wong is accused of the same offence involving another document containing the permission granted to Goodway Rubber Industries Sdn Bhd for the disposal of the same used machines that did not take place. She is accused of committing the offence at Grant Thornton Malaysia’s office at Sheraton Imperial Court, along Jalan Sultan Ismail, between January and February 2021, under Section 18 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009. The offence is punishable under Section 24 (2) of the same Act with imprisonment of up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the value of the false details or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction. As for Tai, he pleaded not guilty to three charges of colluding with Wong to commit the offence at the same location and date. The charges were framed under Section 28(1)(c) of the MACC Act 2009, read together with Section 8 of the same Act, punishable under Section 24(2) of the act, which carries an imprisonment of up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the value of the false information or RM10,000 whichever is higher, upon conviction. — Bernama ',\n",

Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Allaudeen Abdul Majid said 20 raids were conducted recently to detect the call centres, which were mostly operating behind the facade of luxury premises. “How can a luxury condominium allow foreign individuals to go in and out of their premises freely? Even for us (locals), it is hard,” he told the press after attending the Kuala Lumpur Police Chief’s monthly assembly today. Therefore, the police will check guards to track their involvement with syndicates, with Allaudeen advising luxury condominium management bodies to be vigilant of the call centres’ modus operandi. “We are preparing to work with condominium management bodies, and the District Commercial Crimes Investigation Division (CCID) has been mobilised to eradicate these syndicates once and for all,” he said, adding that Kuala Lumpur should be safeguarded from becoming the syndicates’ main hub. The CCID conducted 1,311 raids related to online crimes between January and September. Of that number, 71 investigations have been initiated with the detention of 855 individuals related to call centre scams. — Bernama ',\n",

Perak police chief Datuk Seri Mohd Yusri Hassan Basri said that based on the police report received yesterday, it was found that the female victim from Kampung Sungai Tapah Tambahan here had been contacted by suspects, posing as a courier company employee and police officers. He said the investigation found that on Sept 25, the victim, who was at home at the time, received a phone call from an unknown individual who introduced himself as an employee of a courier company and said that the victim had a package delivery problem. He added that the victim was then purportedly connected to the Penang police contingent headquarters line by an employee of the courier company and had spoken to an ‘inspector’ and a ‘sergeant’. “The victim was tricked by the suspects who disguised themselves as police officers by providing a picture of the front of her bank card to them,” he said in a statement today. Mohd Yusri said the victim only became aware of the suspects’ fraud after her daughter checked her mobile phone. He said the victim suffered a total loss of RM127,560 in three transactions to three bank accounts belonging to different individuals between Oct 9 and 10, with the case now being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. He also reminded the public to always be alert to suspicious phone calls, especially if they are allegedly from courier companies or government agencies. The public can call the National Scam Response Centre (NSRC) at 997 if they are victims of phone scams or cybercrimes and have just made a transaction to a mule account, he said.

Judge Norina Zainol Abidin handed down the sentence after the 38-year-old pleaded guilty to the charge and ordered the accused to serve six months in jail if he failed to pay the fine. The court also ordered the accused to be placed on a five-year good behaviour bond, undergo counselling on parenting organised by the Social Welfare Department (JKM), and carry out 200 hours of community service to be completed within six months starting today. The man was charged with causing injuries to the boy at a house in Taman Sri Rampai, Wangsa Maju, at 6am on June 23. The charge, framed under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, carries a maximum fine of RM50,000, 20 years’ imprisonment, or both upon conviction. According to the case facts, the victim would get up as early as 5am to help his mother and the accused prepare nasi lemak before doing his homework. The accused scolded and beat the victim with a cane for being unable to answer mathematics questions. The boy then told his teacher about the incident before several JKM officers took him to a doctor, who later found the victim suffered a soft tissue injury over the posterior left knee and posterior right cart due to caning. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Noorhani Muhmmed Ayub asked the court to impose a deterrent sentence against the accused to serve as a lesson for other parents and himself, to refrain from committing the same offence. “The title of father does not permit you to hit the victim to discipline him. The boy should not have been beaten in such a manner for failing to answer mathematics questions. “The victim needs a father’s love because his mother and biological father are divorced,” she said.

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk Azhahari Kamal Ramli also reserved its verdict over the trio’s appeal to challenge certain findings of facts by the High Court, including the findings that the fire which broke out in Nazrin’s room was “done deliberately”. Justice Vazeer Alam, who chaired the panel, said many issues were raised during the submissions by the prosecution and defence, and the panel needs to go through the evidence in detail. “Parties will be informed when we are ready, but it will not be long,” he said after the five-day appeal hearing, which began on September 4. Counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, representing the trio, had earlier completed his submissions. The prosecution, led by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Yusaini Amer Abdul Karim, concluded its submissions on October 17. On June 21, 2022, the Shah Alam High Court freed Samirah, 48, who is also Nazrin’s widow, and two teenagers, who are now 21 and 18, of murdering Nazrin after finding the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the trio at the end of its case. The three of them and an Indonesian woman, Eka Wahyu Lestari, who is still at large, were charged with killing Nazrin, 45, at his house in Mutiara Damansara between 11.30pm on June 13, 2018, and 4am the following day. Earlier, Muhammad Shafee submitted that the demise of the deceased (Nazrin) was a tragic accidental death and not murder. He said the defence had unveiled compelling evidence and testimonies of witnesses who disproved the allegation of incendiary fire, the alleged finding of petrol and the various elements of the murder charge. The counsel pointed out that the prosecution has not presented any credible evidence, let alone circumstantial evidence pointing to the irresistible conclusion that the accused persons had committed the murder. “To date, the prosecution cannot explain how the deceased sustained the blast-type injuries and how the blast-like pattern appeared on the master bedroom wall. “As such, the defence humbly prays that the prosecution’s appeal be dismissed, and the trial’s judge’s order of discharge and acquittal on the accused persons be upheld. “The defence humbly seeks the intervention of this court to correct the misdirection of fact and law by the learned trial judge concerning the acceptance of the finding of incendiary fire and petrol by the Fire and Rescue Department,” said Muhammad Shafee. — Bernama ',\n",

Penang police chief Datuk Khaw Kok Chin said the state Narcotics Crime Investigation Department (NCID), together with Bukit Aman NCID, launched a planned operation from 9am on Friday (October 20) until yesterday and raided six locations in the Timur Laut and Barat Daya districts. “In the first raid, police arrested a 27-year-old man, the mastermind, by the roadside in the Tanjung Tokong area at 9pm (on Friday) and seized various types of drugs in his car, parked about 200 metres away. “Police then arrested another man in the Gelugor area at 12.20am (on Saturday) and two more men, aged 28 and 33, at Lebuh Sungai Pinang at 1am (on Saturday). “Following the arrest of these three, we seized various types of heroin and syabu kept in cars parked not far from where they were detained. Their modus operandi is to leave the vehicles containing the drugs for the buyers to come and take them without the presence of the (arrested) suspects,” he told a press conference today. Khaw said based on the suspects’ directions, police then raided a two-storey bungalow lot in the Teluk Kumbar area at 7.10pm on Saturday and discovered a heroin-processing laboratory there. The syndicate is believed to have rented the premises, equipped with closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to detect the authorities. They are believed to have carried out their drug processing and trafficking activities since early this year. “Police then raided two more locations yesterday, and based on preliminary investigations, the syndicate obtained its drugs from abroad and processed them at the house before selling them to buyers for the local market, raking in hundreds of thousands of ringgit each month. “The four who were arrested were drug distributors. Several other suspects, believed to have expertise in ‘cooking’ heroin, are still on the loose, and we are tracking them down,” he said, adding the syndicate has a network abroad and in several other states. In the raids, police seized heroin weighing 23.38kg, heroin base (18.4kg), syabu (1.507kg), caffeine powder (94.4kg), and various types of chemicals used for processing heroin, along with three cars. The police also confiscated six cars, cash, jewellery, and two motorcycles, which amounted to RM191,595. The seized narcotics can feed the drug habit of an estimated 1.22 million addicts. “One of the suspects has a cleaning company, while the other three are unemployed. Two of them have drug and crime-related records,” he said, adding that all the suspects have been remanded for a week, and the case is being investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. — Bernama   ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Oct 20 — A former judge and a businessman failed again in their appeals today to recover RM182,100 seized by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) four years ago. This comes after a decision by the Court of Appeal’s three-judge panel, chaired by Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, in dismissing the appeals by Azmil Muntapha Abas, 49, and Leong Peng Woon, 68, and upholding the decision of the Shah Alam High Court which dismissed the duo’s appeal to recover the money. Vazeer Alam, sitting with Judge Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah, said in a unanimous decision there was no error in the High Court’s decision, and the respondent (prosecutor) had proved that the application to forfeit the right to the money was following the law. “We are also satisfied the claims of the two appellants have also been considered by both courts (High Court and Sessions Court), and the decision reached by the court is based on the correct facts and law. “Therefore, the appeals of both appellants are rejected,” he said. On November 23, 2021, the Sessions Court allowed the government’s application to forfeit the money found in Azmil Muntapha’s office during a raid conducted by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in 2019. Azmil Muntapha, then the Judge of the Kuala Kubu Bharu Sessions Court, claimed he obtained the money from Leong, who is a contractor, through a RM200,000 loan to buy a house on auction in Hulu Selangor. The two then appealed against the decision in the High Court, which dismissed the appeals on April 10. Earlier, lawyer Awang Armadajaya Awang Mahmud, representing the appellants, submitted that the RM182,100 cannot be taken arbitrarily but can only be forfeited if the appellants failed to prove it was clean money. “The money is not related to official business but a loan from a friend to purchase a house in Hulu Selangor. The money has nothing to do with the corruption charge against the first appellant (Azmil Muntapha),” he said. Meanwhile, deputy public prosecutor Fauziah Daud said, as stated in the investigating officer’s affidavit, the money was confiscated in connection with an offence under Section 17 (a) of the MACC Act 2009, which is obtaining a bribe from an agent. “The first appellant said the money was borrowed from the second appellant (Leong), but the money in question was found in a very suspicious place, namely in the judge’s chambers. “Therefore, we are satisfied with the MACC’s investigation, which determined the money was from illegal sources,” she said. On October 19, 2022, Azmil was sentenced to six months in prison and fined RM25,000 by the Shah Alam Sessions Court after he was found guilty of corruption. Azmil Muntapha was charged as a Sessions Court judge to have obtained for himself RM5,000 without consideration from a person he knew had a connection with his official function involving court proceedings of six accused in criminal cases. He appealed against the decision, and the Shah Alam High Court reduced the sentence to one day jail and a RM12,000 fine. — Bernama ',\n",

He said those detained comprised 130 men and six women from Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand, aged between 20 and 70, who committed various offences, including overstaying and lacking travel documents. “Our initial investigation found these foreigners were renting in two condominium blocks with three or four-bedroom units, housing at least eight individuals. “Some were found staying in the penthouse, which indicates that they have a good source of income,” he told reporters after the operation. Ruslin said the immigration would investigate and summon the homeowners and condominium management to determine whether the houses were rented by employers or the foreigners themselves. It is understood that most of the foreigners were renting rooms in the condominium with rental rates between RM500 and RM800 per month. He added that the condominium had been raided before and several illegal immigrants were detained. Meanwhile, Ruslin said a total of 3,016 foreigners were inspected in the operation that took place from 1 am to 4 am, involving 338 immigration personnel from Putrajaya, Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, Kuala Lumpur and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Those detained were taken to the Immigration Depot in Semenyih, Selangor for further investigation under the Immigration Act 1959/63, Passports Act 1966 and Immigration Regulations 1963.

The victim’s counsel, Nik Nur Syazwani Nik Suhaimi, said his client was awarded the damages after the Federal Court ruled that all nine respondents, including five former school students and four other respondents, were responsible and negligent in the incident of beating, bullying, and attacking the appellant (victim). “The Federal Court also unanimously upheld the Kuala Terengganu High Court’s decision and set aside the Court of Appeal’s decision. Therefore, all respondents are directed to pay compensation to the appellant,” she said when contacted today. Yesterday, a three-judge panel comprising Court of Appeal president Tan Sri Amar Abang Iskandar Abang Hashim and Federal court judges Datuk Mary Lim Thiam Suan and Datuk Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil allowed the appellant’s appeal in an online proceeding. The appellant was represented by lawyers Wan Azliana Wan Adnan, Hisyam Yusof and Diyana Ibrahim, while Federal Counsels Andi Razalijaya A. Dadi and Zureen Elina Mohd Dom represented all the respondents. On April 2, 2017, the boy, who was 14 when bullied, filed a lawsuit through his father against five Form Five school students as the first to fifth defendants. The victim is now 22. The other defendants were the senior assistant (student affairs), the principal, the Education Ministry director-general and the Malaysian government. The victim claimed he was beaten, bullied, and attacked by the five senior students, resulting in a ruptured right eardrum. The incident on April 26, 2015, left the victim with permanent disabilities, hearing loss, and severe trauma and emotional distress, leading him to undergo psychiatric treatment. On September 29, 2019, the Kuala Terengganu High Court ordered all defendants to pay compensation amounting to RM616,634.20 after allowing the plaintiff’s lawsuit. In his judgment, High Court judge Zainal Azman found the school negligent in allowing the bullying to happen in the prefects’ dormitory. However, on May 20, 2021, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s decision. It ruled the plaintiff failed to prove the liability of the five senior students who had beaten, bullied, and attacked him while finding the other defendants not liable for the incident. — Bernama ',\n",

MACC Chief Commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki said three mills were raided today and the remaining two yesterday. He said MACC is not looking at issues of rice hoarding but rather potential elements of corruption. “MACC’s perspective is more on corruption offences that may occur, especially if it involves government funds related to subsidies and if they are misappropriated,” he said. He said this at a press conference after attending the Public Private Partnership Phase Two: The Joint Challenge of Integrity in Dealing with Crime programme, here, today. “I do not rule out the possibility that there will be other mills that will be inspected by the MACC to see that the subsidies paid are not commercialised with the rice production that is distributed,” he said. “In addition, MACC does not target any politician or any state government in the issue (raiding rice mills in Kedah) because our job is to examine any information and complaints received.”  Azam said MACC will act professionally to investigate individuals or parties involved. “Any party involved in the criminal issue of corruption and abuse of power will be our concern regardless of their background,” he said. He said MACC officers need to examine documents such as claims to see if there are elements of corruption and irregularities. According to him, MACC will also call the parties that regulate rice to help investigate the case. Commenting on another MACC investigations involving a businessman with a ‘Datuk’ title and his partner, who were arrested with RM38 million in cash in July, Azam said the investigation into the case is still ongoing. He said the probe is being carried out by a multi-agency task force including the MACC. “The task force is made up of various government agencies such as the Inland Revenue Board and others,” he said On July 25 this year, a ‘Datuk’ businessman and his partner were arrested in a massive operation. During the arrests, 200kg of gold worth RM60 million and 17 luxury cars were seized. — Bernama ',\n",

The syndicate had coerced the 18-year-old to hide in a ploy they conceived, so the syndicate could demand a RM300,000 ransom from his family. Director of the Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department (JSJ) Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said police managed to find the victim cowering in fear at a homestay rented by the youth himself in Shah Alam on October 5, following a police report made by his mother on October 3. The victim received a call from a syndicate member on September 30 who posed as a policeman, saying a package containing drugs was addressed to him. “After the syndicate ordered (forced) him to make a payment to avoid police action, the teenager then deposited money amounting to RM283,000 in four separate transactions into two different accounts four days in a row starting on September 30,” he said at a special press conference in Bukit Aman today. After the man could no longer pay up, he was told to go into hiding on October 3 and to provide his mother’s phone number to the syndicate. The syndicate then contacted the woman claiming her son had been kidnapped, and demanded a RM300,000 ransom. “Police managed to arrest two men, aged 32 and 24, in Penang and Kulim, Kedah, on October 7 and October 9, who acted as a mule account holder and a middleman of the syndicate. “The man acting as an intermediary claimed he receives a RM6,000 monthly payment from the syndicate in question to withdraw the money deposited by the fraud victim to be deposited into another account. “Both of them were remanded until October 14, and the case is investigated according to Section 365 of the Penal Code for kidnapping,” Shuhaily said. He reminded the public that the police would never discuss a case over the phone, and hence, they should be wary when receiving a call from anyone claiming to be a police officer. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah dismissed Goh Jie Keat’s appeal to reduce his jail sentence. Justice Vazeer, who delivered the court’s decision, said the 20 years’ jail sentence was not manifestly excessive considering how Goh had caused the girl’s death. He said Goh’s appeal did not have merit, adding the High Court judge had applied the correct principle of sentencing when imposing the 20 years’ jail term. Goh, 27, was initially charged with the murder of Serena Yip Pei Yee at a house in Jalan Kuang Gunung 4, Taman Kepong in Kuala Lumpur, between 7pm and 8pm on June 18, 2018. After eleven prosecution witnesses testified, Goh submitted a representation to the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) and his representation was accepted for the murder charge to be reduced to culpable homicide, not amounting to murder. On July 13, 2021, the High Court sentenced Goh to 20 years in jail after he pleaded guilty to culpable homicide not amounting to a murder charge. He, however, appealed to the Court of Appeal for a lower jail term. According to the case facts, Goh was cutting a plastic package with a pair of scissors when his niece persistently teased him and asked him to play with her. He could not bear the teasing and stabbed the child. Goh was 21 years old when he committed the offence. Post-mortem results showed that the child had 56 stab wounds on her body. Lawyer N. Subramaniyan from the National Legal Aid Foundation asked the court to impose a jail sentence of between 12 and 15 years, saying it was not a premeditated act but happened at the spur of the moment. Deputy Public Prosecutor Norzilati Izhani Zainal@Zainol submitted the sentence was appropriate considering the seriousness of the offence and the deceased was only three years old. — Bernama ',\n",

Md Shahzada Saju’s appeal for a lower imprisonment term was dismissed today by the court’s three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah. In delivering the court decision, Justice Vazeer said the 20-year jail sentence was appropriate based on the circumstances of the case, where the killing was done in a gruesome manner. He said the High Court had not committed any error in imposing the 20 years’ jail term, and the appellate court did not want to disturb the sentence. Md Shahzada, 42, a former waiter, was initially charged on August 7, 2018, with murdering Sajeda-E Bulbul, 29, also a Bangladeshi, in an unnumbered room, in Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah in Dang Wangi, Kuala Lumpur, between 4.15am on July 3 and 3.16am on July 5, 2018. Acting on information, police inspected the scene and found two luggage containing the woman’s dismembered body parts by the riverbank of Sungai Gombak near Jalan Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur. A post-mortem confirmed her death was caused by an incised wound to the neck with decapitation. The police arrested Md Shahzada in Pengerang, Johor, on July 25, 2018. On May 26 last year, the High Court reduced Md Shahzada’s murder charge to the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder at the end of the prosecution’s case. He pleaded guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 20 years in jail. He, however, appealed to the Court of Appeal to reduce his jail term. The man was represented by lawyers Vijey Esvaren and M.

Lokman said from the 239 offences identified, 23 were found to have expired licences or no licence at all but driving commercial vehicles. “Imagine 23 commercial vehicles are being driven by drivers who do not have a licence, or their licence had expired. This is certainly going to pose a serious danger to other road users, especially vehicles that a smaller in size. “We know that whenever commercial vehicles are involved in accidents, the drivers of the commercial vehicles do not suffer serious injuries, but others involved in the accidents may suffer serious injuries or in many cases, such accidents can be fatal.” He added that under a Special Ops for Motorcycles throughout last month, 135,446 notices or summons were issued for various offences, including lack of insurance, licence, road tax and for breaching traffic rules. The RTD also seized 6,567 motorcycles that failed to meet the specifications or guidelines provided for under the safety requirements with many of these offenders ranging from the age of 16 to 35. —  Bernama ',\n",

Both suspects have been remanded, and the cases are being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code. “We wish to remind the public always to be wary and not to easily fall for these types of tricks by such syndicates on social media, be it non-existent loans, foreign job offers or such,” the statement added.

Judge Rozina Ayob made the ruling after finding the charges could be improved, and it did not prejudice Datuk Seri Sim Choo Thiam, 53, as the applicant. “After examining all the cause papers, the applicant’s (Sim) request to set aside the four charges was rejected,” she said. The court also rejected the applicant’s request for the public prosecutor as the respondent to furnish a fresh written statement of facts favourable to his defence. The case was handled by Deputy Public Prosecutor Nor Asma Ahmad, while lawyer Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik represented Sim.

Sim claimed it was only after he was charged in court that the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) proceeded to record a statement from former home minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin, whose name was mentioned in his (Sim) charges. The case trial has been set for ten days, from May 6 to May 10 and May 13 to May 17, 2024, where the prosecution will call 20 witnesses to testify.

He warned that action will be taken against anyone who is deemed to have said or done anything detrimental to the peace and harmony or the security of the country. Earlier today, Lee apologised openly for his statement that was his own interpretation of the Al-Quran verse through a video clip on his social media recently. Lee said he had no intention to touch on the sensitivity of the Muslim community. Perak Jabat president Amiruddin Mohd Daud reportedly said the organisation had lodged a police report seeking an investigation and action to be taken against Lee as they viewed his actions as an insult to Islam as the MP was not a Muslim but had interpreted the verse of the Quran, which they deemed was a 3R issue. — Bernama ',\n",

Mohd Fakhrudin said police had earlier received a report from TM stating that telecommunication equipment and data at the location of the theft, was not functioning due to two large underground cables that stretched for about 40 metres and worth about RM100,000 being severed and stolen. “Acting on the report, a police team from the Petaling Jaya D4 Crime Investigation Department and a Task Force from the Petaling Jaya police headquarters managed to detain the four policemen for assisting the syndicate. “Following the arrest of the four policemen, nine others were detained, including foreigners, aged between 20 and 40, at five different locations in the Klang Valley, the next day,” he said in a press conference, here today. He added that during the raids, police also seized two multi-purpose vehicles, three cars and a a lorry as well as 11 handphones. “Also seized were a sack of copper wires weighing 1.2 tonnes, a record book with details of sales and receipt, vests with reflectors and a crowbar,” he said. Initial investigations revealed that the syndicate was actively involved in cable theft in the district while the four policemen are believed to have assisted the syndicate in their criminal activities for a specific payment. He added that the four policemen who have been in service with the police force for between seven and 15 years, have been suspended from their duties and if they are proven to have been involved, they will be charged in court. “The nine suspects who also had previous criminal records would be remanded for six days to assist in investigations under Section 431A of the Penal Code.

This followed a unanimous decision by a panel of three judges led by Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail to reinstate the Shah Alam Sessions Court’s decision, made on April 9, 2018,  in sentencing  Wan Ji to nine months in prison for the offence, and dismissed his appeal against the conviction and sentence. In reinstating the Shah Alam Sessions Court’s decision, Judge Hadhariah also set aside the decision of the Shah Alam High Court in July 2019 which sentenced Wan Ji, 41, to one year in prison. She said Wan Ji’s appeal had no merit because there was a lot of evidence showing that the appellant was the owner of the Facebook page. “Regarding the issue of punishment, the high court judge has no reason to increase the punishment. The sentence of nine months’ imprisonment should have been upheld. “Therefore, the court sets aside the one-year prison sentence handed down by the Shah Alam High Court against Wan Ji and reinstates the decision of the Shah Alam Sessions Court,” said Hadhariah who sat with judges Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin. On the claim of no offence in the Sedition Act 1948 by Wan Ji in his appeal, she said the freedom of speech “The words said in the appellant’s Facebook are indeed inappropriate. If we are a genius in religious matters, we should not belittle others. “If you want to give religious advice, say it well. Don’t use inappropriate words, especially against the Sultan of Selangor, because now there are (laws against speaking on issues of religion, royalty and race. Be careful with these sensitive words,” she added. x Hadhariah said freedom of speech does not give an absolute right for someone to speak at will as there are still limits that need to be maintained “Don’t offend others, be submissive. The cleverer, you are, the more submissive you have to be. Don’t belittle other people,” said the judge. At today’s proceedings, the prosecution was conducted by deputy public prosecutor How May Ling, while lawyer Muhammad Faiz Fadzil represented Wan Ji. Wan Ji had appealed against the one-year prison sentence imposed by the Shah Alam High Court in July 2019 after allowing the prosecution’s cross-appeal to increase the nine-month prison sentence handed down by the Shah Alam Sessions Court on April 9, 2018. On April 9, 2018, Sessions Court judge  Mohd Sabri Ismail sentenced  Wan Ji to nine months in jail after finding him guilty of publishing words that insulted the Sultan of Selangor Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah on Facebook. He was charged under Section 4(1)(c) of the Sedition Act 1948 which provides for a maximum fine of RM5,000 or imprisonment of not more than three years or both for the first offence, and to a maximum of five years imprisonment for the second and subsequent offences. – Bernama ',\n",

Penang police chief Datuk Khaw Kok Chin said the 34-year-old victim from Medan, who was on a holiday trip with her three female friends, was kidnapped on September 7 in Paya Terubong. “However, the suspects released the woman’s friends unharmed, and the victim was taken to Butterworth where she was locked up. The suspects also kept the victim locked up in different locations to make it hard for the police to find her. “The principal suspect then asked for a ransom from the victim’s 47-year-old husband in Indonesia, who then made two transactions totalling RM50,750. “However, the suspects still did not release the victim and had asked for an additional payment of RM540,000 from the woman’s husband,” he told a press conference today. Khaw said the victim’s husband, worried about his wife’s safety, decided to come to Malaysia and lodged a police report at the Kinrara police station in Selangor on September 15, following which Op Scorpion Rantai was launched to locate the woman. The woman was rescued in a raid on a house in Shah Alam at 5.15am on September 17, and an investigation revealed the victim was locked up for three days in Butterworth, four days in Puchong, and three days in Shah Alam. “During the raid, the police also rescued an Indonesian man who was also kidnapped by the suspects for an unrelated case,” he said. According to Khaw, the victim was found with injuries all over her body and was believed to have been chained, burned with cigarettes, beaten, and had her fingernails shoved down with needles and her hands and feet bound with cable ties. “When found, the victim was in a weak condition. However, the woman, who is an online trader, was fed by the suspects and is currently being treated at the hospital and reported to be in a stable condition,” he said. Further investigation revealed the main suspect was the victim’s husband’s business partner and the kidnapping was motivated by the man’s failure to pay a business debt. “Both of them (the main suspect and the victim’s husband) are contractors who run a business in Kuala Lumpur. “The police also seized several items including 23 mobile phones, 36 cable ties, RM4,800 cash, a metal chain, and vehicles used by the suspects to transport the victim,” Khaw said. The operation also led to the arrest of 14 individuals including the 35-year-old main suspect and two foreign men, in several locations in Selangor, Perak, and Kuala Lumpur on the same day the victim was rescued. The suspects have been remanded for seven days until September 23, and the case is being investigated under Section 3(1) of the Kidnapping Act 1961. — Bernama ',\n",

The three-man bench comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah allowed the prosecution’s appeal to overturn a High Court decision to acquit and discharge Kassim Tahir for the offence. In the court’s unanimous decision, Justice Hadhariah said Kassim’s conviction for the offence is restored. On the sentence, she said the court set aside the Sessions Court’s decision to impose ten years imprisonment for each charge and replaced it with eight years imprisonment for each charge to run concurrently. The sentence of whipping imposed by the Sessions Court on Kassim for each charge has been set aside. Justice Hadhariah ordered Kassim to begin his sentence today, and said the eight years jail sentence would also take into account the time served by him (Kassim). Earlier, she said the High Court erred in ruling that a preliminary inquiry should have been held before the Sessions Court accepted the victim’s evidence. On July 16, 2019, the Sessions Court sentenced Kassim to 10 years imprisonment with one stroke of the rotan for each charge, and Kassim was ordered to serve the sentences concurrently. On September 8, 2020, the High Court overturned the Sessions Court’s decision and acquitted and discharged him. According to the charge sheet, Kassim committed the offences in the bus in Ulu Tiram, Johor at 8pm between April 2016 and May 2016. Deputy public prosecutor Aida Khairuleen Azli submitted the Sessions Court judge did not need to conduct a preliminary inquiry under Section 133A of the Evidence Act as the victim was not a child of tender years when he testified in the court. She said the victim was already 14 years old when he provided detailed testimony on what Kassim did to him. In mitigation, the lawyer from the National Legal Aid Foundation Che Muji Che Noh representing Kassim said her client is suffering from a kidney problem and also asked the court to reduce the jail sentence. — Bernama ',\n",

They were ordered to serve the sentences from August 13, 2016, the date of their arrest. Court of Appeal’s three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk S. M. Komathy Suppiah set aside the death sentence for drug trafficking imposed on the trio by the High Court, after ruling their conviction was not safe. In delivering the court’s decision, Justice Hadhariah said the charge against the three men was defective as it was worded as trafficking by manufacturing the drug when it should have been a preparatory act to manufacture the drugs. She said the High Court judge failed to give a direction to the accused persons at the end of the prosecution’s case whether there was actual or presumed possession for them to prepare their defences and that adverse inference should also be drawn on the prosecution for not calling or offering material witnesses to the defence. Justice Hadhariah also said the court is exercising its discretion to reduce the charge to possession of the drugs. Dinakaran, an odd job worker, Asraful, a former student and Arivazhagan, a labourer, subsequently pleaded guilty to the charge. In 2019, the High Court found them guilty of trafficking 9,179.34 grammes of methamphetamine at a house in Jalan 3, Ampang, Selangor at noon on August 13, 2016.

The probe is related to a statement that touched on a border-conflict between Malaysia-Indonesia, property that belong to a leader, and exposing a major confidential document that belonged to a government department on social media. Shuhaily said police had received six reports and five investigation papers related to the case have been opened. “Police have called him up to offer his cooperation but he failed to present himself.

Shuhaily said Chegu Bard’s failure to assist the police to complete their investigation is akin to challenging the law of the country and the police. “It includes failing to come to the Kajang police headquarters this morning, prompting police to seek a warrant of arrest from the Kuala Lumpur Magistrates Court,” he said. Meanwhile, asked if the arrest was related to the proposed ‘Perhimpunan Selamatkan Malaysia’, Shuhaily denied such notion. “Once again I wish to reiterate that the detention of Chegu Bard tonight had nothing to do with the proposed gathering on Saturday because he was not among those who applied for the gathering,” he said.

A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali, and Datuk See Mun Chun dismissed the appeal by PKK1 after concluding that the High Court’s conviction of him was safe and should be upheld. The same panel also dismissed the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision in acquitting and discharging another man (PKK2), also aged 22, of the murder without calling for his defence. Justice Che Mohd Ruzima, who read out the court’s decision, said the court agreed with the findings of the High Court judge in ruling that the circumstantial evidence presented by the prosecution was strong and pointed to one direction, namely that PKK1, along with another unidentified person, climbed behind the school’s fence to start a fire in the school which killed 23 people. He said the prosecution succeeded in proving through circumstantial evidence that the young man was responsible for starting the fire at the tahfiz school, knowing his actions were dangerous and could lead to death. “We agree with the findings of the High Court judge that the minor offender (PKK1) chose a lighter from several lighters in his bedroom, which shows that he knew which lighter he was using to start the fire at the tahfiz school,” Che Mohd Ruzima said. PKK1’s conduct was admissible under Section 8 of the Evidence Act 1950 and could be considered as part of the circumstantial evidence supporting the prima facie case against him. He said High Court Judge Datuk Azman Abdullah (now a Court of Appeal judge) was not wrong in his decision to reject the young man’s defence of alibi. This was based on the evidence of the defence and the prosecution that the young man was at the back fence of the tahfiz school building before the fire broke out. Regarding the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision to acquit and discharge PKK2, Justice Che Mohd Ruzima said the decision was factually and legally correct. This was based on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove that PKK2 was the one who inflicted bodily harm on all the victims and that he had the intention to cause death when doing the act. The court disagreed with the prosecution’s argument that PKK2 was the second person who climbed over the fence at the back of the tahfiz school along with PKK1, on the morning of the incident. He said that in proving the circumstantial evidence supporting the statements of the two prosecution witnesses, the prosecution relied on the inference on the size of the opening of the barbed wire fence of the building which was not that big and submitted that the second person who entered the tahfiz school compound together with the first youth was PKK2 due to his small body size. “We have found there is doubt about the facts regarding the fence at the back of the tahfiz school. Therefore, the conclusion relied upon by the prosecution to support the statements of two witnesses cannot be safely used against PKK2,” Justice Che Mohd Ruzima said. Two prosecution witnesses had testified that they saw an unidentified person climbing the back fence of the tahfiz school together with PKK1. On the contrary, the fact can also lead to the conclusion that the persons who climbed over the back fence along with PKK1 were probably two other witnesses who were also present at the scene. In his statement of defence, PKK1 denied having climbed the fence at the back of tahfiz school, but claimed that he was with his friends, namely PKK2 and the two witnesses. “If there is more than one inference, then the inference in favour of PKK2 must prevail, and the benefit of the conclusion must be in favour of PKK2,” he said. PKK1, who is now 22 years old, is appealing against the High Court ruling on August 17, 2020, ordering him to be detained at the pleasure of the Agong after finding him guilty of the murder. He was 16 years old at the time of the incident. According to the charge, the youth, together with another person still at large, was accused of murdering and causing the death of 23 people in the tahfiz centre at Jalan Keramat Hujung, Kampung Datuk Keramat, Wangsa Maju here, between 4.15am and 6.45am on September 14, 2017. He was charged with 23 counts of murder, each framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code and read together with Section 34 of the same law, which provides for the mandatory death sentence upon conviction. However, Section 97(1) of the Child Act 2001 stipulates that a death sentence shall not be pronounced or recorded against a person convicted of an offence if the child is under the age of 18, and in lieu of the death sentence, as provided under Section 97 (2) of the same law, the court shall order the person to be detained at the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. — Bernama ',\n",

State Police chief Datuk Seri Yahaya Othman said that during the same period, the Pahang Narcotics Crime Investigation Department also confiscated, among others, various vehicles and over RM2.2 million cash. He said, in addition to daily arrests, police also engaged in various anti-drug operations in the state via the 2nd Ops Hawk in Pekan, Maran, Lipis and here from Tuesday until yesterday. He added that the operations, involving more than 100 police officers and other personnel, arrested 287 individuals, including nine women, aged between 17 and 60 and also seized various types of drugs with an estimated valued of RM38,830. “Among the offences committed were for trafficking, testing positive and arrests involving wanted persons, four men were also held under the Dangerous Drugs (Special Preventive Measures) Act 1985.” He added that the operations targeted Felda areas, riversides and fishermen’s jetties. Yahaya also said, Ops Hawk, managed to reduce the number of “pots” to obtain drugs in Pahang by shutting down five “pots” in Felda areas and one at a riverside. He said police also took the initiative by enhancing enforcement under Section 39C of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which is that hardcore addicts or repeat offenders will be handed longer jail terms of not less than five years and a whipping. “This approach can separate the hardcore addicts and new addicts, whereby through this separation the new addicts have a higher chance to be rehabilitated without being influenced by the hardcore users.” — Bernama ',\n",

Chow Kum Yuen, 37, was sentenced to 18 years in jail and 20 strokes of the cane, while S. Inthiran, 31, was given a 12-year imprisonment term and ten strokes of the cane after they pleaded guilty before the Federal Court’s three-member panel of judges to the drug possession charges. The duo’s cases were heard separately today by the panel comprising Chief Justice Tun Tengku Maimun Tuan Mat and Federal Court judges Datuk Harmindar Singh Dhaliwal and Datuk Rhodzariah Bujang. The court set aside the duo’s conviction and death sentences for the drug trafficking offences and substituted it with a charge for possession of the drugs. This was after Chow’s lawyer Datuk Hisyam Teh Poh Teik and Inthiran’s counsel Datuk Baljit Singh respectively informed the court that the Attorney-General’s Chambers had accepted their representations for the drug trafficking charges to be substituted to possession, which was confirmed by deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Mohd Amril Johari who appeared for the prosecution for Chow’s case as well as DPP Parvin Hameedah Natchiar appearing for the prosecution in Inthiran’s case. Chow, a mechanic, pleaded guilty to four charges of possessing 163.6gm of nimetazepam, 1819.61 grammes of Ecstasy, 163.71gm Methamphetamine and 482.96gm of ketamine at a house in Jalan Desa Mesra, Jalan Kelang, Taman Desa, Kuala Lumpur on April 18, 2017. On November 22, 2019, the High Court found Chow guilty of four charges of drug trafficking and sentenced him to death. The court also found him guilty on a charge of possessing 51.80gm of cannabis and sentenced him to ten years in prison and ten strokes of cane. Chow only appealed to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and death sentence for the drug trafficking offences, but his appeal was dismissed on March 9 last year. Today, Justice Tengku Maimun sentenced Chow to five years in jail each for the charges of possessing nimetazepam and ketamine and an 18-year imprisonment term and ten strokes of the cane each for the other two charges. She ordered the sentences to run concurrently from April 18, 2017, the date of his arrest. Chow will receive 24 strokes of caning instead of 30 strokes as Section 288 (5) of the Criminal Procedure Code states that for a person who is convicted for two or more distinct offences, the combined sentences of whipping awarded by the court for such offences shall not exceed 24 strokes. Meanwhile, Inthiran, a lorry driver, pleaded guilty to possessing 2238.49gm of heroin in front of a mini market in Jalan Desa Jaya 1, Taman Jana Jaya 11, Kamunting, Perak on March 29, 2017. He was initially found guilty of trafficking the drugs and sentenced to death by the High Court on April 6, 2018. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on March 10, last year. Justice Tengku Maimun ordered Inthiran to serve 12 years in jail which to begin from the date of his arrest on March 29, 2017, and also ordered him to be given ten strokes of the cane. — Bernama ',\n",

Bukit Aman Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said the 41-year-old local man was arrested at 3.20pm yesterday, at Taman Desa Budiman, Bedong in  Kedah. He said that the police received a report on the matter, and deployed a team of police officers from the Kuala Muda district police headquarters to arrest the man, who worked as a masseur. “The suspect wrote the threatening message on Saturday (Aug 26), on his  Facebook account, ‘JoeJebat Tajudin’,” he said at a special press conference in Bukit Aman, here today. He said the man, who has three criminal records for drug abuse, was remanded for four days, from today, to assist with investigations.

The man, 42, lodged a police report about the matter at 6.24pm yesterday, stating he had received a phone call from the number 012-233 4005 from an unknown male claiming to be an officer from the Kuala Lumpur post office. “The first suspect, posing as the post officer, claimed that there was a parcel containing the victim’s identification card and several credit cards to be sent to Sarawak,” he said, adding that the victim was then directed by the first suspect to lodge an online complaint with the Melaka district police headquarters after he denied knowing about the package. The first suspect then connected the call to the second suspect, who claimed to be a police officer with a ‘Datuk’ title, and proceeded to inform the victim that he had to transfer as much as  RM146,450 to an account provided by the suspect for investigation purposes. The victim was in a state of panic and confusion so he complied and made 38 transactions to six bank accounts totalling RM186,450 from Thursday until yesterday. He was then told by the second suspect that he would be contacted after the investigation was completed within 30 minutes, but realised he had been scammed after he did not receive a call and the number was blocked when he decided to call.

Tan I-Lyn, 39, who is also the company’s administrative manager pleaded not guilty after the charges against her were read before Judge Datin Sabariah Othman. She was charged as an employee at Ada Vinci Global Sdn Bhd — which was entrusted with managing the company’s finances — of committing CBT, by taking RM58,354 and RM1,518,422.88 belonging to the company for her own use. Tan was accused of committing the act at the company’s premises in Menara YNH Kiara 163, Mont Kiara, between December 3, 2021, and December 10, 2022, according to Section 408 of the Penal Code which carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years, with whipping and a fine, if convicted. Deputy Public Prosecutor Noor Shakira Aliana Alias suggested a bail amount of RM120,000 for both charges with the additional condition that the accused’s passport be handed over to the court until the case is resolved. Lawyer Azzuan Shah Abd Razak who represented the accused requested a lower bail on the grounds his client had to support her parents, and that her bank account had been frozen since December last year. “The client also suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure while her parents, both 75, are in Penang and could not be present in court today due to health and age factors,” said the lawyer. The court allowed the accused to be bailed at RM70,000 for both charges along with the additional condition proposed by the prosecution, and set September 27 for mention of the case. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Suzana Hussin dismissed the application by Hydroshoppe Sdn Bhd director Datuk Abdul Hamid Shaikh Abdul Razak Shaikh, 49, after hearing the submission by both parties. Abdul Hamid Shaikh applied last May 31 because the charge against him under Section 16 (b)(B) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 was flawed and unfounded because it did not state the necessary details, namely the specific date for the alleged offence. Earlier, lawyer Amer Hamzah Arshad, representing the accused, told the court that his client wanted to apply for a temporary release of his passport to go to the United Kingdom (UK) to send his son, who is pursuing studies there, and also to the United States for business purposes. “He needs to be in the UK on September 12 and for business purposes in the United States on October 1. If the application is allowed, I request my client’s presence be excluded on the next mention date,” he said. Deputy public prosecutor from MACC, Mahadi Abdul Jumaat, said the defence will have to file a notice of application and a supporting affidavit to support the application for the purpose. “We need to check the date and reason for the application before deciding to protest or not because of the long period abroad,” he said. The court then ordered Abdul Hamid Shaikh to file the application and fixed September 12 for mention. Abdul Hamid Shaikh was charged on April 5 this year with offering a bribe of RM500,000 a year for 15 years for the benefit of Tan Sri Annuar Musa in connection with the take-over of KL Tower concession. He was alleged to have offered the bribe through Datuk Tan Ser Lay, 60, as an inducement for the then Communications and Multimedia Minister to expedite the takeover process of KL Tower concession by the company. He is accused of committing the act at the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, Federal Government Administration Center, Putrajaya between July and August 2022 The offence was allegedly committed at the Communications and Multimedia Ministry in Putrajaya between July and August 2022. — Bernama ',\n",

The 42-year-old man was initially acquitted and discharged by the Sessions Court on April 20, 2021, for sexually assaulting his daughter, who was 13 years and four months old at that time, at an unnumbered house in a village in Kampar, Perak, on July 2018. The charge was framed under Section 14 (a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 which is punishable with a jail term not exceeding 20 years and shall be liable to whipping, upon conviction. The prosecution appealed against the decision and on June 30 last year, the High Court allowed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the man’s acquittal. The High Court convicted the man for the offence and sentenced him to 10 years in jail and two strokes of the cane. It also imposed an additional sentence of three years in jail and four strokes of the cane provided under Section 16 (1) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 as he was in a relationship of trust with the victim, who is his biological daughter.

The syndicate was believed to have been active for the past two months, and its modus operandi was to use vehicles to store drugs before distributing them to buyers. “In the first raid, a Thai married couple working in restaurants and a local man working at a horse farm in Selangor were arrested by the roadside of Taman Permata, Cheras.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Aug 23 — A married couple escaped the gallows after the Court of Appeal today commuted their death sentence to a maximum jail sentence of 40 years for murdering their daughter. A three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah upheld the conviction against Anuar Yusof and his wife Murni Ahmad for the offence. It ruled their appeals did not have merits. Justice Hadhariah, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision, said the court found there was overwhelming evidence the 22-year-old Siti Hajar died due to the acts by the couple, who are her father and stepmother, by neglecting, abusing and starving her for a period of three to six months. She, however, set aside the death sentence imposed on the couple by the High Court and substituted it with an imprisonment of 40 years and ordered them to begin their jail sentence from the date of their arrest on April 26, 2016. “This is a very sad case and the worst case under Section 302 of the Penal Code that we have read,” said Justice Hadhariah. Following an amendment to Section 302 of the Penal Code, the court can impose a jail term of not less than 30 years and not exceeding 40 years on offenders if not given the death sentence. Male offenders shall also be punished with whipping of not less than 12 strokes. Anuar, 57, and Murni, 42, were found guilty by the High Court in 2021 for murdering Siti Hajar in a house along Jalan Air Putih, Taman Semarak, Binjai in Chukai at 10.45pm on April 26, 2016. They were sentenced to death, prompting them to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Apart from the couple, two of their children, Siti Sarah Anuar and her brother (who was 14 years old at the time of the incident) were also charged with murdering Siti Hajar, but they were acquitted and discharged by the High Court. The prosecution filed an appeal but it was struck out on January 10 last year, as they could not serve the notice of appeal to them. Siti Hajar weighed around 18 kg when she died. The deceased resided with her biological father, her stepmother, an older sister, and a younger brother in a rented house since 2008. The facts of the case revealed that Siti Hajar was highly emaciated with no flesh and only skin and bones. She had wounds on the head and bruises on her body including her anus. A forensic expert who examined the body confirmed Siti Hajar died due to bacterial infection in the lungs and anus caused by abuse, starvation and neglect. She also had 36 human bite marks on her back, both hands and feet and on her genital area. A witness testified in the trial that whenever Siti Hajar’s siblings wanted to eat, they were required to beat her up first and only after that will their mother allow them to eat. Lawyer Ghazali Ismail represented the couple while deputy public prosecutor Norzilati Izhani Zainal appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Yahaya said the victim, who was afraid of the threat claimed he had been instructed to transfer money from his savings account to five different accounts given by the second suspect allegedly for the purpose of investigation. However, he said the victim got suspicious after failing to contact the suspect to ask about the progress of the investigation, causing him to go to the police station to lodge a report yesterday.

The three-member panel of judges comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim, and Datuk S.M. Komathy Suppiah also ordered Sam Chai Ewon, 42, to be whipped 12 times. In delivering the court’s unanimous decision, Justice Hadhariah said Sam’s conviction for the murder is safe to be upheld, and the court dismisses his appeal against his conviction. She said Sam’s conduct that had caused Kamal Long’s death was cruel. On the sentence, Justice Hadhariah, however, set aside the death sentence imposed on Sam by the High Court and replaced it with 35 years in jail and 12 strokes of the cane. Sam was found guilty by the High Court on October 8, 2021, for murdering Kamal, 50, a lifeguard, at the corridor of the Awana Sri Layang workers’ quarters in Genting Highlands in Bentong, Pahang at 10.30pm on October 4, 2017. He was sentenced to death. A bellman at the resort testified in the trial that he saw Sam kick Kamal’s face and on his ribs, and step on the deceased’s chest and face, causing him to hit his head on the wall. The witness claimed that Sam was ‘like kicking a ball’. In defence, the accused said Kamal, who was his roommate, had occasionally been stealing his belongings. He said on the night of the incident, both of them, whom he said shared a good relationship, were drinking alcohol in their room and were both drunk. He said after returning from the toilet, Sam realised that his handphone was missing and alleged that the deceased had taken it. Angered at this perceived theft, he demanded of Kamal as to where the handphone was but was told he (Kamal) did not know, at which Sam began beating him Lawyer Nik Mohamd Ikhwan Nik Mahamud, who was appointed by the court to represent Sam, asked the court to commute his client’s death sentence to imprisonment saying that Sam did not have the intention to cause the death of his best friend and that he only wanted to injure him. He said it was an error on the part of his client, who had resorted to violence instead of resolving the dispute. Deputy public prosecutor Parvin Hameedah Natchiar argued that witnesses who saw Sam hitting, kicking and injuring the deceased were warned by him (Sam) not to interfere. She said it was Sam’s attacks that evening that led to Kamal’s death, adding that the Kuala Lumpur Hospital forensic specialist testified that the deceased have suffered severe bleeding in his brain which resulted in his death. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Norhazani Hamzah made the order after Deputy Public Prosecutor Nurfadzlin Mahmad Zulhasnan applied for Safiey, 29, whose real name is Mohd Safiuddin Ilias, to be granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal of all four counts. “The case has been dismissed. The accused is granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal from all the charges and bail is returned,” Norhazani said. Earlier, Nurfadzlin said the prosecution made the application on the grounds the accused will be charged again in Pahang and Johor as the victims, who are also witnesses in the case, were residing in those two states respectively. “If the trial is to proceed in this court, it will inconvenience the victims as they will have to travel back and forth,” he said. Lawyer, Harjeet Singh Sidhu, representing Safiey, had also urged the court to discharge and acquit his client of the four charges, saying the case has been going on for too long. The court today was supposed to hear Safiey’s preliminary objection against two of the four charges he was facing. Before this, the court had set the trial dates for September 4, September 5, September 11, and October 2. Safiey was charged with two counts of sexually communicating with two victims through his Instagram account at his residence in Bandar Baru Bangi at 9am on June 9, 2021. The Syinta Gila singer also faced two counts of non-physical sexual assault against the victims at the same location, time and date. The charges are framed under Section 11(1)(a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017, which carries a maximum prison sentence of three years, and Section 15 (a)(i), which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or a fine of up to RM20,000 or both upon conviction. — Bernama ',\n",

Both of them pleaded not guilty to the charges. Housewife Nurul Asyiqin Mohamad Zahir, 27, and her girlfriend, Singaporean Awiin Chua, 30, who is a technician, as the persons having care of the child, were jointly charged with abusing and neglecting the boy, causing the victim to suffer physical injuries. The two women were charged with committing the offences in a house at Jalan Wau Kikik 7, Bandar Layang Kasa, Pasir Gudang between July 1 and Aug 9 this year. They were charged under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, read together with Section 34 of the Penal Code,  and faced a maximum fine of RM50,000 or imprisonment of not more than 20 years or both. Deputy public prosecutor Nur Diyana Zubir in requesting the court to impose bail of RM30,000 on each of the accused, said the victim was staying with his grandparents in Kedah when the first accused, who is his biological mother took him away to Johor. However, she failed to take care of the victim,  she added. As for the Singaporean, Nur Diyana said she was living in the same house as the first accused, hence responsible for taking care of the boy, although they had no blood ties. “The child is now at the Sultan Ismail Hospital here and is being cared for by his uncle pending a decision by the Social Welfare Department on his custody, she said. Lawyer Abd Rahim Ali, representing the two accused, said the first accused, who has another child, a nine-year-old, is not a flight risk as she has been unemployed for the past two months and has no passport. The second accused is working in Singapore, but residing in Pasir Gudang, and she has a valid passport and a permit to be in the country, he added. Judge Hakim Fatimah Zahari then allowed Nurul Asyiqin bail of RM15,000 in one surety for all charges, while the bail for Awiin was set at RM20,000 in one local surety for both charges. They were also ordered to report themselves at a police station once a month pending the disposal of their case and to not intimidate the victim. The court set Sept 27 for mention to obtain the medical report on the victim. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Che Wan Zaidi Che Wan Ibrahim meted out the sentence on Nurul Shahira A’shiqin Sulaiman, 28, who maintained her guilty plea after the charges were read out again during sentencing today. The judge also ordered Nurul Shahira to serve a bond of good behaviour for two years with a surety of RM20,000 for each charge and 100 hours of community service within the next six months for both offences. Che Wan said as a trusted caregiver at the daycare centre, she had acted recklessly with the babies, which might have caused them physical injuries. “Therefore, the court should mete out a sentence that would serve as a lesson to you, the community, kindergarten or daycare centres, that they must be careful in future,” he said. Deputy public prosecutor Nurul Syafiqah Sha’ari appeared for the prosecution, while the accused was represented by lawyer Syufri A. Samad. On May 21, Nurul Shahira A’shiqin pleaded guilty to acting negligently with a nine-month-old baby girl and a seven-month-old baby boy at a daycare centre located at Jalan Utama 34, Taman Mutiara Rini, here at about 1pm in March.

Judge K. Muniandy meted out the sentence after allowing the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Sept 15, 2022 decision of the Sessions Court to free Sabudin, 62, of both the corruption charges. He ordered the four-year prison sentence for each count to run concurrently, effective today, and the RM1 million fine, in default four years imprisonment. Judge Muniandy allowed the application of Sabudin’s lawyer K.Theivaendran to stay the execution pending his appeal at the Court of Appeal. Earlier, during submission, deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin, assisted by Natrah Fareha Rahmat, requested a 10-year prison sentence and a fine of RM1 million, taking into account public interest and the seriousness of the offence as it involved corruption. On Dec 18, 2020, the Sessions Court freed Sabudin of the two charges at the end of the prosecution case, but on March 24, 2022, he was ordered to enter his defence by the High Court, allowing the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Sessions Court’s decision. Sabudin was charged with obtaining bribes amounting to RM200,000 from Wong May Kuan, a subcontractor for Dusari Niaga, while he was senior deputy director of City Hall’s civil engineering and urban transport department. Dusari Niaga was carrying out road resurfacing works in Kuala Lumpur from 2018 to 2020 and the bribes were as an inducement to issue work permits for the company. The charges under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act 2009 are punishable by imprisonment of up to 20 years and a fine of five times the bribe or RM10,000 whichever is higher, upon conviction. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Aug 15 —The Court of Appeal today overturned a decision made by the Temerloh High Court which had barred the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission’s (MACC) officers from using the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to remand suspects for further investigations. Instead, the court’s three-man bench comprising Judges Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin allowed the MACC’s appeal to set aside the decision of the then judicial commissioner Roslan Mat Nor now High Court judge that the Commission must rely on its own MACC Act 2009 to apply for remand of suspects if it did not complete investigations within 24 hours of the arrest of the suspects. In delivering the court’s unanimous decision, Vazeer said the then judicial commissioner had erred in his interpretation of Section 49 of the MACC Act. “We note there is no specific provision in the MACC Act as to the course of investigation which is not completed within 24 hours.” He said MACC officers can use Section 29 (3) of the MACC Act and apply to the magistrate for a remand order against the suspects under Section 117 of the CPC if their investigation cannot be completed 24 hours after the arrest of the suspects. In his grounds of judgment dated May 11 this year, Roslan had ruled that MACC cannot use the CPC to remand suspects for further investigations and the Commission must use section 49 of the MACC Act 2009 which gives it specific powers to do so. He said MACC officers can make an arrest under section 49 (2) of the MACC Act and can ask for a remand order under section 49 (3) of the same Act. Roslan, in exercising his revisionary power, ruled that the remand order issued by a senior assistant registrar of the Temerloh High Court against six policemen including an inspector under Section 117 of the CPC did not comply with the law and hence, set aside the remand order. Deputy public prosecutor Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar appearing for the MACC today argued that Roslan had erred when he decided that Section 49 of the MACC Act is the sole provision that the MACC officers should rely on for the investigation and remand of suspects. He said that the provisions under the MACC Act and the CPC were applicable for any investigation carried out against suspects for offences under the MACC Act. Lawyer Datuk Geethan Ram representing three of the policemen countered by saying that the policemen were arrested for an offence allegedly committed under the MACC Act and as such the provisions of the MACC Act apply to the case and not the provisions under the CPC. As for the other three policemen, lawyers Revin Kumar Shasai Kumar, Lavanyia Raja and Eu Kah Mun were appointed individually to represent them. — Bernama ',\n",

Muallim police chief Mohd Hasni Mohd Nasir said the 38-year-old woman disclosed that the deception began when she received a phone call from a man claiming to be an employee of a courier company on Aug 3. “The caller stated that the victim had two parcels in her name containing five identity cards, five passports and five bank cards belonging to other people, before being connected to what was said to be the Perak and Bukit Aman contingent police headquarters with the syndicate’s intention of convincing the victim,” he said today. Mohd Hasni said the suspect, who was posing as an investigating officer, claimed there was an arrest warrant out on the victim for money laundering including human trafficking which ‘forced’ the woman to follow instructions including transferring the entire sum to 16 different accounts. “The panic-stricken woman followed the suspect’s instructions by transferring her money amounting to RM537,659 to the accounts given by the syndicate from Aug 3 to Aug 12 through 25 transactions.” He said the lecturer only realised she was the victim of a fraud syndicate after her husband saw his wife’s peculiar behaviour of nervously glancing at the phone and wanting to borrow money to make payments. The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code while the public is advised not to be easily deceived by similar modus operandi and to always check with the National Scam Response Centre at the 997 number.

However, the 53-year-old accused will only have to serve a 42-year prison sentence after Judge Abu Bakar Manat ordered the sentences for all rape and sexual offences to run concurrently from the date of his arrest on July 10 and he will also only receive a maximum of 24 strokes of the rotan, which is the legal limit. According to the first to 19th charge, the cleaning worker is accused of raping his two daughters, who were then 9 and 10 years old, at two houses in Bakri and Jalan Jeram Tepi, Muar here, since 2018 and the last time was on July 9. The charges were in accordance with Section 376 (3) of the Penal Code which provides for a prison sentence of up to 30 years and 10 lashes if convicted. As for the 21st to 30th charge, the accused is accused of sexually assaulting both victims at the same location and time in accordance with Section 14 (a) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 and read together with Section 16(1) of the same act which provides imprisonment of up to 20 years and whipping. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Danial Munir asked the court to mete out a heavy sentence because the offence committed by the accused was serious and left lifelong trauma on both of his children due to being raped from childhood until one victim was five weeks pregnant. The accused, who was not represented by a lawyer, appealed for a lighter sentence on the grounds that he had repented and regretted his actions. The court sentenced him to 30 years in prison and 10 strokes of the rotan for each count of rape. For the charge of physical sexual assault, the court sentenced him to 10 years in prison and two whippings for each charge under Section 14 and an additional two years in prison and two lashes for each charge under Section 16. —Bernama   ',\n",

In the suit filed on Aug 17 last year, SM Faisal, 43, claimed that Che Muna uploaded four defamatory posts on her Facebook account, Mona Din,  between June 29 and 20 July 20, 2022. He claimed that the posts by Cik Muna, among other things, depicted him as a cruel and inconsiderate person who caused trauma to his ex-wife, as well as claiming that he used his money and position to manipulate the justice system in the country. Meanwhile, Che Muna in her defence statement filed on Sept 28 last year, claimed that the posts were fair and reasonable comments because the issue was of public interest. The issue was over Emilia’s imprisonment for contempt of court. On Sept 4, 2019, the Syariah High Court sentenced her to seven days in jail for the offence, which was for defying a court order on the visitation dates of her three children to be with their father. SM Faisal also filed a defamation suit against rapper Caprice, whose real name is Ariz Ramli, and the case had also been resolved amicably with the court recording the consent judgment last Aug 4. SM Faisal filed the suit against the rapper on Aug 15 last year for allegedly uploading a defamatory posting on his Instagram linking the businessman to his ex-wife, Emilia Hanafi’s case. — Bernama ',\n",

Kota Kinabalu district police chief ACP Mohd Zaidi Abdullah said in a statement today that police discovered a video of the incident, and preliminary investigations revealed it occurred at a kindergarten in Luyang. The victim’s parents discovered from their child that he was abused by the worker and was hurt in several areas of his body. Subsequently, the parents went to the kindergarten and viewed the closed-circuit TV recording of the incident. “The police have also received three police reports, from the parents, the kindergarten operator, and the worker who claimed the victim’s parents hit her. Both the victim and the suspect have been referred to Queen Elizabeth II Hospital for checkups by doctors,” he said. A two-minute 12-second video, made from a mobile phone recording of the CCTV footage, depicted the worker kicking the boy before scolding him and hitting him in full view of other children. — Bernama ',\n",

Mohamad Safiq Rosli, 37, pleaded not guilty to the charge which was read out before Magistrate Sasha Diana Sabtu. He was alleged to have stalked the woman by repeatedly harassing her through three communications on his Twitter account last month. According to the charge, Mohamad Safiq was charged with repeatedly harassing Acacia Mardiana Daud, 31, through the Twitter application under the account name “@sopert99” by sending three communications which expressed his feelings for the woman on her Twitter account “@ShaFoShizzle” which was read at a house here. He was alleged to have committed the offence between 1.40 am last July 15 and 5.58 pm on July 21 despite knowing that the act is likely to cause, distress, fear or alarm to her. He faced imprisonment for up to three years or with a fine or with both if found guilty. Deputy public prosecutor Zilfinaz Abbas did not offer bail taking into account that Mohamad Safiq had previously violated bail conditions for a case involving the same victim in the United Kingdom (UK). Lawyer Fithril Hakim Ab Jalil, representing Mohamad Safiq, did not object to it. According to Zilfinaz, the accused was supposed to appear in a court in the UK to explain for breaching his bail last June 2, but he fled to Malaysia resulting in his name being blacklisted in the UK. “I was also instructed to send the accused for observation to the Forensic Psychiatry Unit at Ulu Kinta Hospital. “His family had also sent him to Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) for treatment and the hospital has given a medical report on him today,” she said, adding that Mohamad Safiq has been warded at the psychiatric ward at HKL since last July 17. Meanwhile, lawyer Jason Wee, who is holding a watching brief for  Acacia Mardiana,  applied for a protection order for the woman to avoid further harassment by Mohamad Safiq. “This order ought to be given to my client to avoid further harassment due to safety concerns. The accused flew to the UK to continue such acts against the same victim. “We humbly pray to restrain the accused from going anywhere near the victim and not to communicate by any means with the victim until the conclusion of this case,” he said. Sasha Diana allowed the prosecution’s request to refer the accused to Ulu Kinta Hospital and will set the bail amount on the accused after the hospital had completed its observation of him. The court also allowed Wee’s application for a protection order and fixed Sept 7 for mention. Through a recent post on Instagram,  Acacia Mardiana revealed that she had been living in fear for eight years because of sexual harassment by a man on social media. Her plight caught the attention of Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil who advised Acacia Mardiana to submit evidence including police reports and screenshots to the government’s official email for further action. — Bernama ',\n",

Customs Director-General Datuk Zazuli Johan said in the 8pm raid, a team from the Narcotics Branch of the Customs Department headquarters seized four boxes containing 995 glass bottles containing capsules suspected to contain cocaine. “The inspection also found vehicle spare parts, such as car brake discs in each box. The syndicate tried to hide or obscure the shipment from the authorities by declaring the shipment as containing supplements. “This is the first time that a syndicate has tried to use such a method. The syndicate also used a fake company name as the receiving company in the air waybill.” He said the initial investigation found the merchandise was imported from the Netherlands with the KLIA Cargo Complex being the final destination with the drug supply being for domestic distribution. Zazuli said the investigation also found the importer had used false information in the import documents, which made it difficult to arrest the importer. “However, investigations are underway to track down a suspect, who is believed to be a local citizen under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952,” he said, adding that from January to July, a total of 382 drug cases involving seizures valued at RM180.5 million had been succeaafully thwarted.

Seberang Perai Utara police chief ACP Mohd Asri Shafie said the 35-year-old victim is receiving treatment at the Penang Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is closely monitored by specialists. “Based on information from a doctor who treated the victim, the woman remains in critical condition, and the medical team was monitoring her closely,” he said when contacted by Bernama today. The police are in the process of tracking down the husband, and believe the suspect is hiding in Penang or a neighbouring state. “Initial investigations revealed the suspect was seen leaving the plantation yesterday in a factory van. Police are now tracking down the van to seek information about the suspect’s movement and to assist in investigations,” Mohd Asri said. He urged members of the public and witnesses to come forward and provide information about the 36-year-old suspect, so the police can take appropriate action under Section 326 of the Penal Code. During the 9.30pm incident, the woman suffered third-degree burns after being set on fire by her husband, following an argument in their house. Police were informed about the incident at 10.45pm by neighbours, and a team arrived at the scene before sending the victim to the Kepala Batas Hospital for treatment as the woman had suffered 27 per cent burns. Investigations revealed that the husband and wife, who have four children aged between 10 ad 13, worked in an oil palm plantation and lived in a house provided by their employer. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Aug 2 — The Court of Appeal today upheld the death sentence imposed on a businessman for trafficking in 9.528 kg of cannabis. This followed a decision by a three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, comprising Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk See Mee Chun, and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, in dismissing the appeal by Mohammad Firdaus Mohsin, 38, to set aside his conviction and death sentence. Justice Hadhariah, in delivering the court’s decision, said there were no merits in the appeal by Mohammad Firdaus. She said Mohammad Firdaus’s conviction was safe to be upheld. On December 3, 2021, the High Court in Shah Alam found Mohammad Firdaus guilty of trafficking in the drug by the roadside of Jalan Bukit in front of the Kajang KTMB train station in the Hulu Langat district, Selangor at 10pm on March 28, 2017. Mohammad Firdaus has one more avenue of appeal, which is to the Federal Court. According to the facts of the case, a police team, acting on information, went to the area and saw Muhammad Firdaus, who was behaving suspiciously, carrying two bags. A police officer approached him and asked him to open the bags. They found several slabs of compressed dried leaves in one of the bags, which was later confirmed by the Chemistry Department to be cannabis. In his defence, Mohammad Firdaus claimed that the bag was not his but belonged to a Uber driver and was taking care of the bag while waiting for the Uber driver to park the car. He claimed that he came to Kuala Lumpur from Penang to attend an event and was waiting for his uncle to fetch him to his (uncle’s) house in Sungai Ramal, Kajang. During the trial, the Uber driver, Mohd Sabri Salleh, testified that he received a booking from Mohammad Firdaus through the Uber app, to send the latter from KL Sentral to the Kajang KTM station. He said he saw Mohammad Firdaus carrying the bags, and he (Mohammad Firdaus) had put the bags next to him (Mohammad Firdaus) in the back seat of the car. Lawyer Afifuddin Ahmad Hafifi represented Mohammad Firdaus, while deputy public prosecutor Mohd Fairuz Johari appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

The Court of Appeal’s three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, and Datuk Wong Kian Kheong also ordered Sufian Sulaiman to be whipped five times. Justice Wong, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision, said there was no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings by the Sessions Court and the High Court which convicted Sufian for the offence. He said the trial judge had considered all the evidence in the case particularly the victim’s conduct who told Sufian’s sister-in-law and a friend of the sister-in-law about the incident. Justice Wong said this case was serious where an employer has the responsibility to protect and safeguard the welfare of his maid but instead, he violated his responsibility. However, he said the court allowed Sufian’s appeal to reduce the jail term from 14 to 12 years. Justice Wong also issued a warrant of committal for Sufian to begin his jail term today. Sufian was given a stay of execution of his jail sentence and released on bail pending his appeal to the Court of Appeal. Sufian, 49, was appealing against the Sessions Court’s decision on May 18, 2018, which found him guilty of raping the maid who was 19 years old at that time at a house in Cheras in Kuala Lumpur, between 3am and 4am on July 2016. The Sessions Court sentenced him to 14 years in jail and five strokes of the cane. He lost his appeal which was dismissed by the High Court on August 28, 2020.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, July 27 — A man and his girlfriend were spared the gallows by the Court of Appeal today for killing their newborn baby girl, who was found with a sock stuffed in her mouth. Fikri Hakim Kamaruddin, 27, and Nurul Filzatun Sahirah Abdul Aziz, 28, were instead sentenced to 30 years in jail. The court also ordered Fikri to be whipped 12 times. In dismissing the duo’s appeal on conviction, the three-man panel of judges led by Justice Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera said after considering the evidence, the court found the prosecution has proven that there was a common intention by the duo to commit the offence. He said there was no contradiction in the evidence given by the nurse and the doctor in the trial. On sentence, Justice Vazeer said at the time the High Court handed down the sentence on the duo in 2021, the punishment for murder was mandatory death. Justice Vazeer said following the amendment to the law, the mandatory death sentence has been abolished and the court has been given the choice or discretion to impose a death sentence or imprisonment of 30 to 40 years and a minimum of 12 strokes of the cane for male offenders. “After considering the mitigations and the facts of the case, we are using our discretion to replace the death sentence to 30 years in jail for both of the appellants (Fikri and Nurul Filzatun) from the date of arrest,” he said, adding that Fikri will also receive 12 strokes of caning. The other judges were Justices Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail and Datuk Wong Kian Kheong. This is the first murder case to be heard by the Court of Appeal after the amendment to the law in April this year to abolish the mandatory death sentence. Under the amendment, judges were given the option to impose jail terms instead of the death penalty. Fikri and Nurul Filzatun were found guilty by the High Court in Johor Bahru on October 31, 2021, for killing their baby girl in a house in Taman Bandar Penawar Utama, Bandar Penawar, Kota Tinggi, Johor Bahru between 10.50pm on December 12, 2017, and 10.41am the next day. According to the facts of the case, Nurul Filzatun had given birth to the baby in a house and was brought to the Kota Tinggi Hospital emergency ward after she suffered from bleeding post-labour. She informed a nurse at the emergency ward that she had given birth to a baby but the baby was taken by her boyfriend. On December 5, 2017, Fikri told a police officer that the baby had been buried. He then led a police team to a forest area in Kampung Panti Kota Tinggi where he buried the baby. The team found the baby’s corpse and sent it for a post-mortem. Autopsy results showed that the baby, who weighed 1.8kg, had been alive at the time of birth and the cause of death was through smothering. The body was found with a small black and blue coloured sock stuffed into her mouth. Both Fikri and Nurul Filzatun were arrested on December 5, 2017. In mitigation, both Fikri’s counsel Anita Vijaya Rajah and Nurul Filzatun’s lawyer Shaik Saleem Shaik Mohamed Daud asked the court not to impose the death sentence. Anita Vijaya said her client had been in love with Nurul Filzatun since 2016 and they were victims of circumstances. She said the duo have another child which was given away. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Datuk Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar, who was assisted by DPP Khairul Aisamuddin Abdul Rahman, urged the court to maintain the death sentence, and if the court disagreed with him, he asked the court to impose at least a 35-year jail term on the duo. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, July 27 — The High Court today found former Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) senior deputy director Sabudin Mohd Salleh guilty on two charges of obtaining bribes amounting to RM200,000 for the issuance of work permits. Judge K. Muniandy made the ruling after allowing the prosecution’s appeal to set aside a Sessions Court’s decision on September 15, 2022, which acquitted Sabudin, 61, of two corruption charges at the end of the defence case. He fixed August 15 to hear mitigation by the accused and to impose the sentence. In his judgment, the judge said an error of law has been committed by the Session Court judge when she misdirected on the law applicable to the evidence of the third prosecution witness (PW3), Wong May Kuan, who for all intends and purposes shall not be regarded as an accomplice pursuant to Section 52 (1) (a) of Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act (MACC). “Although the PW3 was the giver of the bribe, it came about because of the demand made by the accused for sponsorship when PW3 went to see him to lodge a complaint, despite not having obtained the contract for work yet. “Thus, the finding by the Session Court judge is not supported by evidence, and the decision made is against the weight of evidence. The court found that there is no proper judicial evaluation of the evidence,” he said adding that PW3’s attendance at the wedding reception of the accused’s son only makes it more probable for the accused to have known PW3. According to the judge, the payment made was for the work contract awarded to PW3, which is proved by the existence of salient contract documents, like the Work Permit and Certificate of Progress Payments which have got the approval of the accused. Judge Muniandy said by virtue of the errors and misdirection by the Session Court judge, appellate intervention is justified for this court to correct it on appeal. “On that score, this court decides to allow the appeal by the prosecution, thus setting aside the order of discharge and acquittal and substituting it with a finding of guilty and conviction on the two charges preferred against the accused under Section 17 (a) of the MACC Act pursuant to Section 316 (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code,” he said. On December 18, 2020, the Sessions Court acquitted Sabudin of the two charges at the end of the prosecution’s case. However, Sabudin was ordered to enter his defence on both charges after the High Court, on March 24, 2022, allowed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the Sessions Court’s ruling. On both charges, Sabudin, who was then senior deputy director at the DBKL Civil Engineering and Urban Transport division was charged with corruptly receiving a bribe of RM200,000 in cash from Wong, a subcontractor of Dusari Niaga that was tasked with grinding and resurfacing works for Kuala Lumpur City Hall for the Year 2018/2020 (2017/A214) as an inducement for him to issue the work permit to the company. He was charged with committing the offences at a petrol station convenience store at Jalan Lingkaran Tengah 2, Bukit Antarabangsa here, and in front of his residence in Ukay Perdana, Ampang, on June 9, 2018, and January 17, 2019, respectively. The charges were framed under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act which provides imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the amount of bribe involved, or RM10,000, whichever is higher. The prosecution was led by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin meanwhile lawyer K. Theivaendran, represented Sabudin. — Bernama ',\n",

Justice Datuk Vazeer Alam Mydin Meera, who led the three-member bench said the High Court can hear Ng’s application under Section 389 of the Criminal Procedure Code, adding the court agreed with the preliminary objection raised by the prosecution that Ng was allowed to file an application for the High Court to consider her request to vary the terms of the bail order. He said the High Court can consider Ng’s application as it is not functus officio (once the court made a decision it does not have the power to re-examine that decision). Justices Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali and Datuk Wong Kian Kheong also presided on the bench. On May 24, the Shah Alam High Court released Ng on RM500,000 bail pending trial under Section 388 of the Criminal Procedure Code which states a person accused of an unbailable offence can ask to be released on bail, however, she has yet to post the amount due to the high quantum imposed and is currently remanded at Kajang prison. Ng, 33, and her husband Khor Swee Boon, 30, were jointly charged with killing Cho Lim Fong, who died of severe injuries when a parcel left on the bonnet of his car exploded outside a restaurant along Jalan Pandan Indah 1/22, Kuala Lumpur at 8.55pm on December 29, last year. In today’s proceeding, Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Siew Wee raised a preliminary objection saying Ng’s application is incompetent and the appellate court should not entertain the request as she has yet to exhaust her right to apply for a variation of the bail order in the High Court. Ng’s counsel, RSN Rayer asked the court to reduce the bail amount to an affordable sum of RM20,000, arguing that it was unfair for his client to be kept in prison when she was entitled to bail but the High Court judge fixed bail at RM50,000. — Bernama ',\n",

Pamela Faith Aoko Omollo, 39, however, was sentenced to 12 years in jail after the court substituted the charge against her with possession of the drug. Lawyer K. Simon Murali, who was assigned by the court to represent Omollo, informed the three-member bench led by Justice Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said that the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) had accepted his client’s representation for the drug trafficking charge be reduced to possession. Deputy public prosecutor Zaki Asyraf Zubir confirmed the AGC had accepted Omollo’s representation. Justice Kamaludin, who sat with Justices Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, ordered Omollo to serve the jail sentence from November 25, 2016, the day she was arrested. Omollo was found guilty by the Shah Alam High Court on March 16, 2021, of trafficking the drug at the international arrival hall of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Selangor, at 7.45pm on November 25, 2016. The mother of four was sentenced to death. She then appealed to the Court of Appeal against her conviction and sentence. According to the facts of the case, the drug was discovered in a bag where it was concealed by wooden layers covered with black fabric that was fitted on the upper and lower parts of the bag. In mitigating for a lesser jail term, Murali said Omollo, who comes from a poor family, was a victim who fell into the treachery of a person belonging to a drug trafficking syndicate which utilised innocent persons to transport its illicit merchandise. He said she has been in jail for almost seven years and that prolonged incarceration was unjustified and detrimental to Omollo, who has reformed. He said the appropriate jail sentence would be nine years. Zaki Asyraf highlighted to the court two case law authorities relating to the current sentencing trend imposed on offenders for such cases. He said in one case, a person was sentenced to 12 years in jail for possessing 52.95 grammes of methamphetamine while another person possessing more than 1 kg of drugs was given 30 years jail. — Bernama ',\n",

According to a MACC source, the seven individuals, aged between 30 and 60, were arrested at the Kedah MACC office between 5pm and 10.30pm yesterday when they went to have their statements recorded. Those arrested were believed to have conspired with the owners of the vehicles involved by falsifying documents to obtain a reduction in customs duty assessment, even though the vehicles were not eligible for such reductions. The MACC has obtained an order to remand the seven suspects for four days until July 17. The remand order was issued by the Alor Setar Magistrate Nurshahida Abdul Rahim today.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, July 13 — The Court of Appeal has upheld the life imprisonment sentence imposed on an unemployed man for kidnapping three Bangladeshis for ransom nine years ago. The Court’s three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk P. Ravinthran and Datuk Nordin Hassan also upheld the High Court order for Suhaimi Alias, 46, to be whipped 10 times. In the court’s judgment dated July 7, Justice Ravinthran dismissed Suhaimi’s appeal against his conviction and sentence and ruled that there was no reason for the Court of Appeal to interfere with the High Court’s decision. He said there was overwhelming evidence in respect of the common intention of all the accused persons, including Suhaimi, to abduct the victims. “They had impersonated police officers to bring the victims to a hotel room. The victims were blindfolded and confined in the room. This is a criminal act,” Justice Ravinthran said. Suhaimi and two others, Raja Mohd Hafiz Raja Shuib and Myanmar national Nobi Hussein Abutar, were charged with kidnapping the three Bangladeshis — Md Gholam Faruque, Mohamed Rafik and Sojib — for RM50,000 ransom at a mini market in Jalan Meru Klang, Selangor at 4am on March 16, 2014. Raja Hafiz died during the course of the trial and the charge against him was withdrawn in 2017. The High Court proceeded with the trial against Suhaimi and Nobi Hussein and convicted them at the end of the trial. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to be given 10 lashes of whipping. In the 19-page judgment, Justice Ravinthran also said the court finds the 10 lashes of whipping is justified, based on the facts of the case where Suhaimi and his accomplices targeted vulnerable persons such as foreign workers. “They impersonated police officers and abducted them. The ransom demanded was a huge sum. Two of the victims were badly beaten up as the raiding officer told the court that they were immediately sent to the hospital after being rescued,” he said, adding that interference with the sentence of the High Court is not warranted in all the circumstances of the case. Nobi Hussein’s appeal against his conviction and sentence is fixed for hearing on July 26. — Bernama ',\n",

BEC is a type of scam targeting companies where the syndicates are believed to commit fraud by hacking the companies’ email for the purpose of monitoring their transactions before posing as business partners or suppliers to get the companies to wire transfer payments. Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Ramli Mohamed Yoosuf said this was made possible with the cooperation of Bank Negara Malaysia, the respective financial institutions involved and the victim who lodged a police report last Thursday. He said based on its investigation, since January this year, the victim’s company based in Malaysia has been dealing with a company abroad to obtain LPG gas (liquefied petroleum gas). “However, on June 22, the victim’s company received an email from a representative of the supplier company instructing that payment be made to a new account,” he said in a statement last night. Ramli said the company then made a payment to the account, but the victim only realised he was duped when the supplier company informed that they have yet to receive the payment. He said acting on information, the police in collaboration with BNM and the financial institutions involved traced the bank transfers and managed to stop a sum of  RM28,361,636.68 from being transferred to a foreign bank account. Ramli said the case is still being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. He said as a preventive measure, the public, especially businesses that use email in their daily affairs, are reminded to always be careful and ensure that the email they receive is from the real buyer or seller. “Beware if there are instructions related to a change in bank account for payment purposes. Ideally, contact the seller or supplier company via phone call for confirmation,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

Both the offensive posts were read by a Twitter user at 12 noon on October 8, 2021, in an office at Kota Southkey. He was charged under Section 233 (1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998, which provides for a maximum fine of RM50,000 or jail of up to one year or both, and a RM1,000 fine per day for each day of the offence continuing after the conviction. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor S. Thiviya offered bail of RM20,000 for Reymi for both charges. Reymi’s lawyers Jihad Syahida Nadia Zakaria and Nurhazneena Zureen Mohamad Hanafiah asked the court to impose a lower bail, saying the accused was still receiving treatment at Hospital Sultan Ismail as he was suffering from ‘schizophrenia with depression’. Judge VM Mabel Sheela fixed bail at RM4,500 in one surety for the two charges and ordered the accused to surrender his passport to the court and to report to a police station once a month.

Sim was charged with soliciting a RM15 million bribe from Hep Kim Hong, the managing director of Asia Coding Centre Sdn Bhd, through Syed Abu Zafran Syed Ahmad, as an inducement for the then Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin to award projects to the company. He was also charged with three counts of accepting RM15 million in bribes from the same individual as an inducement for Hamzah to do similar things.

All the arrested suspects, aged 19 to 40, are believed to have been active in the scam since May. Cheras District Police Chief ACP Zam Halim Mohamed said the syndicate’s modus operandi was to target Chinese customers through phone calls and impersonate customer service officers and promote the investment in the Telegram app. Speaking at a media conference at the Cheras District Police Headquarters, he said victims who were deceived had to pay RM65 (100 Yuan) to open an account on the Bitcoin website www.icoin.com to be registered. “After opening an account they will be given a username and password to access the website,” Zam Halim said. After that, victims would be asked to make a number of financial transactions with an investment package in the currency of the victim’s choice. He said the syndicate was believed to have been operating in China and the police are still investigating to determine if the group was carrying out activities in Malaysia had any connection. The syndicate was targeting 30 to 50 Chinese customers a day to join the investment. “The syndicate is able to earn 10 to 15 per cent as commission, which is around RM50,000 to RM100,000. “Of the 10 suspects arrested, only one has a valid travel pass.

Magistrate Nurzihan Abdul Rehman imposed the sentence on Wong Siew Lan, 49, who pleaded guilty as charged, and ordered an imprisonment of 12 months, if she failed to settle the fine. She was charged under Section 77A(1) of the Income Tax Act 1967 which requires her to furnish a tax return in the prescribed form C for years of assessment 2021 to 2022 to the Director General of Inland Revenue. Wong failed to file the returns for the taxable income of RM1,827,149 for the assessment year 2021 and RM1,558,176 for 2022, which meant she should have paid a tax of RM812,478 for both the years combined. Under section 112(1A) of the Income Tax Act 1967, the offence was punishable by a fine not exceeding RM20,000 or imprisonment up to six months or both, in addition to a special penalty of triple the tax payable, upon conviction. Prior to sentencing, Wong, a mother of five, who was unrepresented, pleaded for leniency. She said her children were still in school, and her elderly mother and mother-in-law depended on her, adding she has also paid taxes of RM120,000 (RM60,000 each) for both 2021 and 2022. However, Inland Revenue Board (LHDN) senior counsel Norhidayah Yasin requested a commensurate sentence due to the fact that the RM120,000 paid was a mere fraction of the payable tax of RM812,478.

Mohd Zarul Afifi Mohd Zaki was ordered by the Court of Appeal three-member bench led by Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail to serve his jail sentence from today. The 36-year-old man has been on RM8,000 bail pending the disposal of his appeal today. He lost his appeal to set aside his conviction but succeeded in getting the court to reduce his sentence from six years’ jail and two strokes of the cane to just one-year imprisonment. Justice Hadhariah, who sat with Justices Datuk Azman Abdullah and Datuk Azmi Ariffin, said there was overwhelming evidence to support the High Court’s decision to convict Mohd Zarul for the offence. However, she said the court agreed with Mohd Zarul’s counsel M.M Athimulan that the six-year imprisonment and two strokes of the cane were manifestly excessive since there was no force used or injuries inflicted on the victim. On April 28, 2021, the Sessions Court acquitted and discharged Mohd Zarul on the charge of committing sexual physical assault by touching the wrists and stomach of the boy who was taking his bath at 3.10 pm in the bathroom of the school’s hostel in Kuantan, Pahang, on March 23, 2019. On January 18, 2022, the High Court allowed the prosecution’s appeal and convicted Mohd Zarul and sentenced him to six years in jail and two strokes of the cane. Mohd Zarul then appealed to the Court of Appeal. In the appeal proceedings today, Athimulan asked the court to restore the Sessions Court’s decision as he said the court (Sessions Court) had rightly acquitted his client as the incident happened spontaneously and not intentionally. Deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Muhammad Azmi Mashud, who was assisted by DPP Aida Khairuleen Azli argued that Mohd Zarul’s evidence that he did not realise he entered the school compound because he was playing Pokemon Go game on his handphone, was merely a bare denial. He said Mohd Zarul’s testimony that he entered the bathroom to take out his clothes and accidentally touched the victim’s stomach was also a bare denial. — Bernama ',\n",

Sri Sanjeevan’s 16-day detention under the Prevention of Crime Act 1959 (POCA) as unlawful. Sri Sanjeevan’s lawyer S. Preakas confirmed the decision date when contacted by Bernama. The decision date was fixed following case management held before Court of Appeal senior assistant registrar Nur Adilah Halid on Wednesday. On June 21, the appellate court’s three-member bench Justices Datuk S. Nantha Balan, Datuk See Mee Chun and Datuk Azimah Omar heard the appeal and reserved their decision. Sri Sanjevaan, 38, sued the investigating officer ASP Poonnam E Keling, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) and the Government of Malaysia, claiming he was wrongly detained by Poonnam for 16 days from July 10 to 26, 2016, and that he was also assaulted. The anti-crime activist also sought damages for losses and injuries suffered by him. On June 28 last year, High Court judge Datuk Ahmad Bache allowed Sri Sanjeevan’s civil suit for false imprisonment and ordered general, exemplary and aggravated damages to be paid to him. He ordered damages to be assessed in a separate hearing at a later date. The judge also granted a declaration that Sri Sanjeevan’s detention was unlawful and a declaration that his rights under Article 5(1) of the Federal Constitution had been breached by Poonnam. Justice Ahmad found Poonnam to be liable for unlawfully detaining Sri Sanjeevan and the IGP and the government were both vicariously liable for Poonnam’s actions. Sri Sanjeevan was arrested under POCA for alleged involvement in criminal activities on July 10, 2016, and was produced before a magistrate the following day who issued a 21-day remand order. Before the expiry of the 21-day remand period, Sri Sanjeevan filed a habeas corpus application to secure his release from detention. The High Court allowed his application on July 26, 2016, due to a breach of a mandatory procedure under POCA. The government filed an appeal to the Federal Court but subsequently withdrew the appeal. Sri Sanjeevan then filed a civil action against the police and government for false imprisonment. – Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin, who rejected the appeal of Amirruddin Nin, said he found the Sessions Court’s judgment was safe, as there is concrete proof for the conviction. “In my opinion, the trial judge used their discretionary powers well, and there is no reason for me to tamper with the finding that the accused is guilty of the first charge. “The prosecution had successfully proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the trial judge’s conviction of the first charge is upheld,” he said. However, the judge set aside the conviction and sentences for the second and third charges against Amirruddin, 53, after finding that both of them were related to the same case and ordered a refund of the fines paid. Muhammad Jamil also allowed Amirruddin’s appeal to set aside the conviction and fine of RM2,000 per day, which amounted to RM1,958,000, for his continuous failure to comply with the SC’s order to appear for the investigation for a period of 979 days. The Sessions Court had previously allowed Amirruddin’s appeal to stay the sentence until the appeal was heard. He has already served the one-day prison sentence and paid the RM300,000 fine for the three charges. Amirruddin was initially sentenced to one day in jail and a fine of RM300,000 on July 14, 2022, after being found guilty of failing to attend the money laundering probe conducted by the SC at Persiaran Bukit Kiara here on three separate occasions in 2017 and 2018.

Shuhaily listed illegal parking, obstruction of traffic, running red lights, illegal number plates, illegal tinting and various offences related to motorcycles as among the targets of the integrated operation.

Mohd Shuhaily said the exercise is intended to prevent such offences from going out of control and any untoward incidents, as the police will not compromise with anyone involved in criminal activities or traffic offences. “The nature of this operation is to discipline, educate and advise road users to obey all traffic rules as well as the rules of the other enforcement agencies involved,” he said.

In her judgment to free and acquit Rozman, 59, from charges of using his position to obtain contracts for LLPM, Judge Rozina ruled that the prosecution’s failure to call Datuk Wee Jack Seng, then the Labuan Port Authority (LPA) chairman, to testify had brought about an issue of an adverse inference. “Without his (Wee’s) testimony, the question of the accused’s influence on the decision reached by the LPA meeting remains unanswered. “Based on the testimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses, the court finds that the accused is not the highest power in LPA and not the individual who chaired the meetings (on Jan 4, 2018 and March 21, 2018). This shows that there are loopholes in the prosecution’s narrative,” she said, further stating that their testimonies showed that the port authority did not want LLPM to be given the chance to be appointed as the operator. She also said that the prosecution’s foundation for prosecution turned out to be baseless because they failed to prove that there was an operator appointed by LPA, as the decision made during the March 21, 2018 meeting was to defer the appointment of a new operator and there was no such appointment made on that date as well. Judge Rozina also pointed out that the prosecution failed to prove that the accused, Rozman, had taken or asked to take action to ensure LLPM was appointed as operator. “Instead, there is opposing testimony as prosecution witnesses stated that during the LPA meetings, the accused informed that LP Multi Terminal Sdn Bhd had the best potential to be appointed operator and not LLPM,” she ruled. Meanwhile, Rozman, who is Labuan Parti Warisan division chief, told reporters after the ruling today that he was grateful for the court’s decision and thanked his lawyers, family and friends who continued to support him. “Alhamdulilah… thank Allah, right from the start I stated that I was innocent and when I was charged in court, I left it to the court to conduct its matters and was confident of the legal process… today justice has been served,” he said. – Bernama ',\n",

The charge, framed under Section 509 of the Penal Code, provides a term for up to five years or a fine or both, if found guilty. Deputy public prosecutor Anis Farhah Ahmad Hilmi requested bail of RM5,000 with one surety, but lawyer M. Manoharan, representing the accused, whose father is also a former police officer with 39 years of service, requested that his client be given a bond or the lowest bail on the grounds that she had been with the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) for seven years and her actions were merely to discipline the complainant. Meanwhile, in the court before Magistrate Chai Guan Hock, Kumar was charged under Section 506 of the Penal Code with criminally intimidating M. Silverkoomarie, 69, at about noon at the same place and time. The police inspector faced imprisonment for up to two years or a fine or both, if convicted. Kumar was also charged with insulting the modesty of P. Taneswaran, 31, at about 1 pm at the same place and date. Deputy public prosecutor Wan Nur Iman Wan Ahmad Afzal appeared for the prosecution in the case. Kumar was allowed bail of RM5,000 with one surety on all three charges and both courts set August 7 for mention. — Bernama ',\n",

However, no plea was recorded as the offence under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 is under the High Court’s purview. According to the charge sheet, Jehpa Lapi-E, Somphon A-Dam and Arun Kaeofainok were each charged with smuggling a Myanmar man known as Zedul Islam at Bukit Wang Burma, Wang Kelian, Padang Besar between February and April 2013. The other accused, Amree Nesalaeh was charged with smuggling another Myanmar man, Mohd Belal, at the same place at around 5.30 am between August 2014 and March 2015. The charge, framed under Section 26A of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act, carries a maximum jail term of 15 years and a fine, or both, upon conviction. The court did not allow bail and set July 25 as the next mention date for the case to be transferred to the High Court. In May 2015, Malaysia was shocked by the discovery of camps and graves involving illegal immigrants in Wang Kelian on the Malaysia-Thailand border, and the incident drew various reactions from the local and international communities. Upon investigations, the Malaysian Government submitted an extradition request to the Thai government for 10 Thai individuals on Jan 6, 2017, and both countries made efforts to locate all the individuals involved for the extradition process. Yesterday, Home Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said four Thai men wanted in connection with the discovery of the camps and mass graves in Wang Kelian in 2015 have been extradited to Malaysia to face court charges.

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk P. Ravinthran, Datuk Seri Mariana Yahya and Datuk S.M. Komathy unanimously dismissed the prosecution’s final appeal against Sabudin Mohd Salleh’s acquittal. Justice Ravinthran, who led the panel, said there was no documented record of withdrawal of money from company accounts or any banking statement evidence showing that Sabudin had received the money. “The charge against the respondent refers to a time period in August 2018. However, three prosecution witnesses implied it could be in June 2018 because of the date of Hari Raya Puasa or Hari Raya Haji, and it was not very clear. This was no major reason for the Sessions Court to accept the evidence of the three prosecution witnesses. “The Sessions Court did not accept the credibility of the three prosecution witnesses, and we find that there is no reason for this court to interfere with the finding after considering the circumstances of the case. Therefore, we dismiss the prosecution’s appeal and affirmed the decisions of the High Court and Sessions Court,” said Justice Ravinthran. Sabudin, who appeared in court today in a wheelchair, appeared calm after hearing the verdict while his wife was seen performing sujud syukur (prostration of gratitude) and crying in the public gallery. On April 8, 2021, the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court acquitted and discharged Sabudin without calling him to enter his defence on the charge and the Kuala Lumpur High Court on February 28, 2022, affirmed the ruling after rejecting the prosecution’s appeal. Sabudin, 61, who was senior deputy director at DBKL’s Civil Engineering and Urban Transportation Department, was charged with corruptly receiving RM150,000 from Chia Chee Seng, who is a director of Tegap Elit Sdn Bhd, as an inducement for him to verify claims for advance payments submitted by several companies. He was charged with committing the offence at a house in Ukay Perdana here between August 13 and August 19, 2018. The charge was framed under Section 165 of the Penal Code, which provides for imprisonment of up to two years, or a fine, or both, upon conviction.

Ruslin said the initial inspection found that they committed various offences including not having valid travel documents, expired social visit passes and misuse of passes and the detained foreign women were believed to have provided sex services to customers. Also seized were 48 Vietnamese passports and a grey SUV-type vehicle believed to be used to ferry foreign women to places chosen by customers as well as RM6,275 in cash believed to be the result of payment for services offered, he said. It was also found that this syndicate was operating in a three-storey shoplot unit with the first floor as a living quarter while the second and third floors were used as places for sex services.

Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said this success was the result of separate raids on condominiums in Taman Segambut Aman and Jalan Ampang, which were conducted between 6 pm and 11 pm on Tuesday. The suspects, aged 39 and 48, had been actively involved with the syndicate since May this year, he told a press conference here today. He said the seized drugs, comprising 107.5 kg of syabu and 34.7 kg of ganja, were believed to have been smuggled in from a neighbouring country. The syndicate was known for using luxury condominiums to store drugs meant for distribution in the local market, he added. “The seized drugs could feed the habit of 1.4 million drug addicts,” he said. Police also seized two cars – a Toyota Estima and Perodua Alza – and RM30,500 cash during the operations. “Investigations show the local suspect was unemployed and served as a runner for the Iranian, a widower engineer with three children. “The Iranian suspect entered Malaysia using a tourist visa in May and police believe he was the drug supplier and has been involved with the syndicate since 2014 when he was in Iran,” he said. He said the local man tested positive for methamphetamine but both suspects did not have any criminal records. They have been remanded for seven days until June 20 for investigation under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. – Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, June 2 — Hydroshoppe Sdn Bhd director Datuk Abdul Hamid Shaikh Abdul has applied to strike out a corruption charge filed against him two months ago. He was charged on April 5 this year with offering a bribe of RM500,000 a year for 15 years for the benefit of Tan Sri Annuar Musa, in connection with the take-over of the KL Tower concession. The notice was filed through the law firm of Messrs. Chetan Jethwani & Company at the Sessions Court on May 31. This was confirmed by his lawyer Amer Hamzah Arshad, at a proceeding before Sessions Court Judge Suzana Hussin today. The notice was filed on grounds that the charge against Abdul Hamid Shaikh, 49, was flawed and unfounded as it did not meet the requirements for the offence under Section 16 (b)(B) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009. It also stated the charge failed to comply with the provisions of Sections 152, 153 and 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code because one of the important details in the charge, which is the date, was not specified in the charge. Deputy public prosecutor Mahadi Abdul Jumaat, from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) confirmed receiving the notice. Suzana then set June 19 for both parties to file their written submissions and July 18 to decide the matter. The company, Hydroshoppe, as a commercial organisation, was also charged with committing the same offence with the same intention, and at a proceeding before Judge Rozina Ayob, Amer Hamzah told the court the defence has filed an application to stay proceedings for the case against the company, pending the disposal of the case facing Abdul Hamid Shaikh. Meanwhile, Mahadi requested to transfer the case (involving Hydroshoppe as a commercial organisation) to another Sessions Court to be tried together with the case against Abdul Hamid Shaikh. Amer Hamzah objected to the matter and requested the prosecution to make the request in writing. Rozina fixed July 5 to hear the applications by both parties. Abdul Hamid Shaikh had pleaded not guilty and claimed trial to the charge of offering the bribe through Datuk Tan Ser Lay, 60, as an inducement for the then Communications and Multimedia Minister to expedite the takeover process of KL Tower concession by the company. He was alleged to have committed the offence at the Communications and Multimedia Ministry in Putrajaya between July and August 2022. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, June 2 — The High Court today set July 25 July to decide on an appeal by the prosecution against the acquittal of former Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) senior deputy director Sabudin Mohd Salleh on (two) charges of obtaining bribes amounting to RM200,000 for the issuance of work permits. Judge K. Muniandy set the date after hearing submissions by deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin, and lawyer K. Theivaendran who represented Sabudin. In his submission, Wan Shaharuddin argued that the trial judge was confused by the charges against the respondent (Sabudin) and had blamed the appellant (prosecution) for failing to establish the need for the respondent to solicit bribes from the prosecution’s main witness, Wong May Kuan, who is a subcontractor of Dusari Niaga. “The trial judge had committed a gross error and misdirection when he failed to consider the evidence that did not favour the respondent when deciding that the respondent had given an honest testimony,” he said and requested the court to allow its appeal, as well as to set aside Sabudin’s acquittal. Meanwhile, Theivaendran submitted that the trial judge had made the right finding when acquitting his client based on the testimony of witnesses. “Therefore, we request that the prosecution’s appeal be dismissed,” said the lawyer. The appeal by the prosecution was filed last year against a Sessions Court’s decision on September 15, 2022, which acquitted Sabudin, 61, of two corruption charges at the end of the defence case. Sabudin was ordered to enter his defence on both charges after the High Court, on March 24, 2022, allowed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside the December 18, 2020 decision by the Sessions Court in acquitting him of the two charges at the end of the prosecution’s case. On both the charges, Sabudin, who was then senior deputy director at the DBKL Civil Engineering and Urban Transport division was charged with corruptly receiving a bribe of RM200,000 in cash from Wong May Kuan, a subcontractor of Dusari Niaga that was tasked with grinding and resurfacing works for Kuala Lumpur City Hall for the Year 2018/2020 (2017/A214) as an inducement for him to issue work permit to the company. He was charged with committing the offences at a petrol station convenience store at Jalan Lingkaran Tengah 2, Bukit Antarabangsa here, and in front of his residence in Ukay Perdana, Ampang, on June 9, 2018, and January 17, 2019, respectively. The charges were framed under Section 17(a) of the MACC Act which provides imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the amount of bribe involved, or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction. — Bernama ',\n",

In the call, the suspect alleged that the victim had made a claim for the cost of surgery three times in a short period of time and the victim also received a phone call from the same insurance company in early February informing him that he had been involved in a money laundering case. “The scammer said an arrest warrant and warrant to freeze the victim’s bank account had been issued. The phone call was later connected to a woman who identified herself as a ‘deputy public prosecutor’. “The victim was instructed to open an Agro Bank account and provide the phone number given by the suspect during the process of opening the new account and the victim was also told to transfer money from his ASB account into the newly opened account,” he said in a statement today. The suspect also instructed the victim to take out a personal loan of RM350,000 with MBSB bank and transfer it into his Agro Bank account. Muhamad Zaki said the scammer then told the victim that the court needed three months to give him an official decision. “In early April, the victim tried to register online banking for his Agro Bank account but failed because someone had registered using his account number. “The victim then checked at a nearby bank and found that the balance in his account was only RM48.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, May 25 — A teenager who pleaded guilty to four charges of sex-related offences was ordered by the Court of Appeal today to perform 100 hours of community service. This was after the three-member panel comprising Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, Datuk M. Gunalan and Datuk Lim Chong Fong allowed the teenager’s appeal to set aside the lower court’s order that he be sent to Henry Gurney School for three years. Lim, who delivered the court’s decision, said the appropriate order to be given to the male teenager, who is now 18 years old, is for him to perform community service for a total of 100 hours under the supervision of the social welfare department, adding that it also includes counselling and religious and moral education. “We acknowledge the order now meted out against the appellant may not be palatable and ideal to everyone. We prefer to place our trust in the appellant that he has learnt from his hideous episode and will not repeat it,” he said. Lim said the order of the Magistrate’s Court sitting as a Court for Children to send the teenager to Henry Gurney School, which is under the purview of the director-general of Prisons, based on the probation report was illegal as there was an absence of the welfare officer’s explanation in the report to show that the teenager is not suitable to be rehabilitated in an approved school. He said in meting the sentence on a person, the court must strike a balance that serves the public interest and deters the re-commissioning of the crime as well as rehabilitating the person. The court is convinced that the teenager fell astray but he is now filled with remorse and shame for what he did, adding that the teenager’s father had admitted that his son showed a change of attitude for the better. Lim said the teenager now spends more time at home focusing on his studies and less time on his mobile phone and also watches animated shows to avoid the urge to surf pornography websites. Meanwhile, Justice Hadhariah advised the teenager to take the court’s decision as a lesson and warning for him not to repeat the offence or else he would not have a second chance. “If you commit the offence again, the law will take its course. If the sexual offence is under the Penal Code, then the sentence under that provision will apply,” she said. Justice Hadhariah also said it was the responsibility of the welfare officers to decide what type of community service to give to the teenager. She also directed the prosecution to serve the court’s order to the welfare officers for it to be enforced on the teenager and asked the prosecution to report back to the court to ensure that the order is carried out by the officers. The boy was 15 years old at the time he committed the offences against his friends and his younger sister. He was charged at the Sepang Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court for Children, on two counts of physical sexual assault and another charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature. He was also charged at the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court of Children, on one count of physical sexual assault. On September 23, 2020, the Sepang Magistrate’s Court ordered the teenager to be placed in Henry Gurney School for three years while the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court made the same order on February 4, 2021, after he pleaded guilty to all the charges. His appeal against the order was dismissed by the High Court on November 5, 2021, prompting him to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Lawyer Mohd Khairul Azam Abdul Aziz appeared for the teenager, while deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee appeared for the prosecution. — Bernama ',\n",

Mohd Rasyidi Mohd Said, 43, and Datuk Roy, or real name Mohd Hussein Mohd Nasir, 54, pleaded not guilty to the charges before Judge Azura Alwi. They were jointly charged with corruptly asking bribes amounting to RM400,000 from Siti Dalena Berhan, 47, as an inducement not to remand Datuk Fakhri Yassin Mahiaddin during MACC’s investigation. The offence was allegedly committed at a restaurant in Bangsar, between 9pm and 11pm on March 5. The two accused are also accused of accepting bribes amounting to RM240,000 from Syed Farid Syed Al Attas, 41, as an inducement not to remand the same individual during the MACC investigation. That offence was allegedly committed at a fast food outlet in Desa Sri Hartamas here between 2pm and 4pm on March 6. They were charged under Section 16 (a) (A) of the MACC Act 2009, punishable under Section 24 of the same Act, which carries up to 20 years jail and a fine of not less than five times the amount of the bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher, upon conviction. Meanwhile, before Judge Suzana Hussin, Mohd Hussien pleaded not guilty to another charge of soliciting a RM2 million bribe from Siti Dalena and Syed Farid.

The offence was allegedly committed at a premise in Kampung Melayu Kepong in February, according to Section 16 (a) (A) of the MACC Act 2009. Bail for Mohd Hussein was set at RM15,000 with one surety for all three charges and Mohd Rasyidi at RM10,000 with one surety with the additional condition that their passports be impounded. They are to also report to the MACC office pending the disposal of the case. The court fixed July 7 for mention. Earlier, the court allowed an application by MACC prosecuting officer T. Armugom for Mohd Hussein’s case to be tried jointly with the other bribery charges he was facing. Deputy public prosecutors Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin dan Nor Diana Nor Azwa were also part of the prosecution team. — Bernama ',\n",

Sabak Bernam District Police chief Supt Agus Salim Mohd Alias said the suspect, who was a former college student, had taken the victim into a car and argued with the 21-year-old woman before hitting her on the head and then killing her at the location at around 10pm. Earlier, Agus Salim said his team received a report from the public regarding the discovery of a body of a local woman found burnt and lying on the ground in the oil palm plantation area at around 8am on Tuesday (May 23). He said they arrested a 20-year-old local man at a residence around Sungai Besar at 1.45pm on Tuesday. “According to the preliminary investigation, the victim’s body is believed to have been burned twice with the aim of disposing of evidence — namely at around 10pm (May 22) and yesterday around 7am — before it was found by the public,” he told a press conference here yesterday. He said the suspect allegedly beat and stabbed his lover with a kitchen knife and slashed the victim’s stomach before burning the body on the night of the incident and returned to the scene the following day with a barrel filled with gasoline to finish off what he started. He said the man also disposed of evidence including items belonging to the victim around Jalan Lama, Kuala Selangor. Agus Salim said checks revealed that the suspect had no criminal record. The suspect and victim were believed to have known each other since last year and the victim was around four months pregnant. He said the suspect was remanded for six days beginning yesterday to assist with investigations according to Section 302 of the Penal Code and the victim’s body, which was 60 per cent burnt, was at the Sungai Buloh Hospital for post-mortem. In a separate case, Agus Salim said his team arrested four Indonesian men aged between 25 and 41 believed to be involved in the trafficking of 30 kg of syabu worth RM1.08 million in the Sekinchan jetty area at 10pm, May 19. He said all the suspects were remanded for seven days starting May, 20 and the case was investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 and Section 6 (1)(c) of the Immigration Act 1959/ 63. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, May 24 — The High Court here today ordered an unemployed man to enter his defence charges of drug possession and trafficking. Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin made the order after finding that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against Mohammad Adhib Kabhir Yazid, 35, at the end of the prosecution case. His girlfriend, Dayang Amiza Mohd Yusof, 40, who was jointly charged with him, was, however, acquitted and discharged without being called to enter her defence. In the judgement, Muhammad Jamil said the action by Mohammad Adhib, in continuing to accelerate his vehicle, despite being instructed by the police to stop, showed that he knew the drugs were in the vehicle. “The drugs were in the custody and control of the accused and not the second accused (Dayang Amiza). Therefore, the court finds the joint intent failed to be proved against the second accused, while a prima facie case had been established against the first accused on all charges,” said the judge. When informed by the judge that he had three options to make his defence, either to remain silent; give evidence in the dock or testify under oath, Mohammad Adhib opted to testify under oath from the witness stand, with the prosecution given the opportunity to question him during cross-examination. The court then set July 12 for the defence trial. Mohammad Adhib Kabhir and Dayang Amiza were jointly charged with trafficking 60.65 grammes of methamphetamine at Batu 6, Jalan Cheras, in front of Cheras Sentral at 2.30am on June 14, 2021. The charge, framed under Section 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, provides the death sentence if found guilty. They were also jointly charged under Section 6 of the same law with possession of 5.22 grammes of cannabis at the same place and time. The offence provides a maximum fine of RM20,000 or imprisonment for up to five years, or both, upon conviction. They were also charged with possession of 3.69 grammes of heroin and monoacetylmorphines at the same place and time. The charge, framed under Section 12(3) of the same law provides a maximum fine of RM100,000 or imprisonment for up to five years, or both if found guilty. Five prosecution witnesses testified in the trial which began in November last year. Deputy public prosecutor Norashikin Ibrahim prosecuted, while lawyers J.

Sessions Court Judge Kamarudin Kamsun said the court postponed the decision as it needed to look into several more matters. “The court sets a new date, July 6, for the decision. I apologise,” he said. Lawyer Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali, who represented Otman, 64, and deputy public prosecutor, Norzilati Izhani Zainal @ Zainol, did not object to the new date. The proceedings for the decision at the end of the defence case were postponed twice, on March 30 and April 19, following Muhammad Rafique’s announcement that the defence team would file additional submissions, before the court set a new date on May 12. On May 12 the proceedings were vacated and postponed to today. The corruption and money laundering case has been going on for seven years, since Otman was first charged on March 31, 2016, and the prosecution has called 70 witnesses to testify. The defence then closed the case on November 29, 2022, after hearing the testimony of the accused, who was the only defence witness. On March 31, 2016, Otman was charged with 32 counts of abuse of power and with submitting false claims, involving RM38.4million, at the National Sports Council Office (MSN), Bukit Jalil National Sports Complex, here, between February 28, 2012, and November 18, 2015. On April 21, 2016, Otman was charged with 64 counts of receiving RM16,623,000 in proceeds from unlawful activities, through cheques which were deposited into his Maybank, RHB and CIMB Berhad accounts, including RHB Bank Presint 8 branch, Putrajaya; Menara Maybank Jalan Tun Perak and Maybank Jalan Raja, between March 7, 2012, and December 11, 2015. The charges were framed under Section 18 (a) and Section 23(1) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009 as well as Section 4(1) (b) of the Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'LOS ANGELES, May 19 – Photographers at the scene of an alleged “near catastrophic” car chase involving Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have disputed the royal couple’s account of the incident, reported German news agency (dpa). Celebrity photo agency Backgrid USA Inc released a statement Thursday defending its freelance photographers who witnessed the alleged chase and denied that the pursuit caused multiple near-collisions on the streets of New York City. Backgrid claims it has reviewed photos and videos from four freelance photographers who were there that night, including three who travelled by car and one who was riding a bicycle. “It is important to note that these photographers have a professional responsibility to cover newsworthy events and personalities, including public figures,” Backgrid said in a statement provided to the L.A. Times. “According to the accounts given by these freelance contributors, they were covering the couple’s stay in New York City, including the possibility of a dinner after an awards ceremony. They had no intention of causing any distress or harm, as their only tool was their cameras. A few of the photos even show Meghan Markle smiling inside a cab.” The paparazzi working for Backgrid went so far as to accuse one of the vehicles in Harry and Meghan’s security escort of “driving in a manner that could be perceived as reckless”. The photo agency alleges that video footage shows the SUV “blocking off streets” and “being pulled over by the police”. (The New York Police Department confirmed with the L.A. Times on Thursday that officers “assisted the private security team protecting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex” that evening.) “We understand that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s security detail had a job to do, and we respect their work,” Backgrid said. “We do, however, want to point out that according to the photographers present, there were no near-collisions or near-crashes during the incident. The photographers have reported feeling that the couple was not in immediate danger at any point.” Still, the photo agency said it is “taking Prince Harry’s allegations seriously and will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter”. Another photographer-witness quoted separately by People magazine dismissed the Sussexes’ “sensational” claims as “crazy hyperbole”. “Nobody got a ticket or arrested,” the photographer told People. “I don’t see how it was near catastrophic.” The statement released Thursday by the duke and duchess tells a different, more harrowing story that many compared to the events leading up to the death of Harry’s mother. The prince has been vocal about his mission to protect his wife and children from suffering the same fate as his mother, who died in a 1997 car crash while her chauffeur was trying to evade paparazzi in Paris. A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan deemed the paparazzi in New York “highly aggressive” and described the chase as a “relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours”. The former actor, her husband and her mother, were tailed by photographers while leaving the Woman of Vision Awards at the Ziegfield Ballroom, where Meghan was among the honorees. “While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone’s safety,” a representative for the Sussexes said. “Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained, encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all involved.” The chase allegedly included six blacked-out vehicles and resulted in several traffic violations, such as driving on the sidewalk, running red lights, reversing down a one-way street, driving while on the phone, driving while snapping photos and illegally blocking a moving vehicle. TMZ reported that one of the paparazzi vehicles drove the wrong way down a one-way street; Harry and Meghan’s car reached 129km per hour on the FDR Drive Highway in Manhattan. At one point, the duke and duchess abandoned their black SUV for a yellow New York taxi in an attempt to lose their pursuers. A cab driver – who said he transported the couple for about 10 minutes of their journey – later told The Washington Post that he felt safe during the trip and would not describe the incident as a chase. He did note, however, that photographers were following them “the whole time”. Representatives for Harry and Meghan did not immediately respond to the L.A. Times’ request for comment. – Bernama-dpa   ',\n",

On the first count, the accused, who at the time of the incident was the Malaysia Building Society Berhad (MBSB) manager, was charged with withdrawing RM220,000 belonging to MBSB using the name and password of another person, resulting in the company incurring losses. The charge was framed under Section 4 (1) of the Computer Crimes Act 1997, which carries a maximum fine of RM150,000 or a jail term of 10 years or both, upon conviction. On the second count, Muhamad Shahrul was accused of making an unauthorised modification of the MBSB Integrated Core Banking (MICOB) system data under Section 5 (1) of the same act, which provides for a fine not exceeding RM100,000 or a maximum jail sentence of seven years, or both if found guilty. He was also charged with committing CBT (amounting to RM220,000), under Section 408 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum of 14 years in jail, whipping, and a fine if convicted.

Taufik Goh Abdullah, 48, was not represented by a lawyer when he pleaded guilty to the charge while lying in a hospital bed, and he was subsequently convicted by the magistrate. The court proceedings were conducted in a hospital in Muar on February 4, 2020, in the presence of the magistrate, the deputy public prosecutor and the investigating officer where Taufik was admitted after he collapsed while being held in remand at the Muar police station and was taken to the hospital. In his appeal today, Taufik, a restaurant owner, questioned the validity of his plea of guilt and also contended that the magistrate did not follow the procedure under Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Justice Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, chairing the three-man Court of Appeal bench dismissed Taufik’s appeal and ruled that his (Taufik’s) appeal against the conviction and custodial sentence imposed by the magistrate was safe. He (Justice Kamaludin) issued a warrant of committal for Taufik, who was present in court in a wheelchair, to begin his jail sentence starting from today. Taufik was allowed RM10,000 bail with one surety pending disposal of his appeal. Justices Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Datuk Azimah Omar were the two other judges presiding with Justice Kamaludin. Two policemen were seen ushering Taufik into the court lock-up after the court delivered the decision. Taufik had pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of possessing stolen property — a Perodua Myvi 1.5 SE — belonging to Nurul Farha Pardi at his restaurant in Kluang, Johor, at 11pm on January 28, 2020. He was sentenced to six months jail, the minimum imprisonment sentence prescribed for the offence. He then filed an appeal to the High Court against his conviction and jail term but it was dismissed on December 19, 2021. On January 25, 2022, Taufik was granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against his conviction and sentence on three questions of law. The question concerned whether his plea of guilt taken was valid, whether there was a miscarriage of justice in the court proceedings and whether a binding-over order could be made instead of a custodial sentence. In today’s proceeding, Taufik’s lawyer G. Visvanathan Nair said his client was on medication at that time and could not decide on his own when he pleaded guilty to the charge and also his client did not understand the nature and consequences of the offence. He also urged the court to either order a retrial or give his client a bound for good behaviour. Deputy public prosecutor Samihah Rhazali, however, submitted that there was no procedural error when the magistrate accepted Taufik’s guilty plea, adding that Taufik was fully aware of the proceeding. — Bernama ',\n",

The accused also pleaded guilty to eight charges under Section 377 CA of the same code for having sex using an object without the victim’s consent which provides for a prison sentence of up to 30 years and whipping. On another 12 charges, the accused pleaded guilty in accordance with Section 14(A) of the Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 which provides for up to 20 years in prison and whipping for committing physical sexual abuse against the youth. The accused also pleaded guilty to the charge under Section 376(1) of the Penal Code which provides for a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and whipping for raping the same victim after she was above the age of 16.

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk Ahmad Zaidi Ibrahim and Mohamed Zaini Mazlan unanimously dismissed Nor Azlam’s appeal against his conviction and sentence after ruling that his appeal did not have merits. In the court’s decision, Justice Hanipah said that based on the totality of the evidence, Nor Azlam’s conviction for the offence was safe. She also said the Sessions Court held that Nor Azlam failed to raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case, adding there was no error by the Sessions Court and the High Court that warranted appellate intervention. Justice Hanipah also said the eight years’ jail and whipping imposed on Nor Azlam by the Sessions Court was not manifestly excessive. She issued a warrant of committal for Nor Azlam to begin his jail sentence from today. Nor Azlam was previously released on bail of RM50,000 pending disposal of his appeal. On October 5, 2019, the Sessions Court found Nor Azlam guilty of committing sexual assault on the 12-year-old girl and sentenced him to eight years in jail and one stroke of the cane. The High Court dismissed his appeal on May 16, 2022.

The Court of Appeal’s three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Seri Kamaludin Md Said, Datuk Hashim Hamzah and Datuk Azman Abdullah rejected Ruslan Bacika’s appeal to have the jail sentence for both offences to be served concurrently. “To us, you are very lucky to get the sentence as compared to another rape case recently where the person got 36 years and 20 strokes of the rotan,” Justice Kamaludin told Ruslan. Ruslan, 59, pleaded guilty at the Sessions Court to a charge of raping the girl in a house on March 27, 2018, and two charges of committing physical sexual assault on the girl on June 15 and June 19, 2018. On February 13, 2019, the Sessions Court sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment and ordered that he be given four strokes of the rotan and ordered the punishment to begin from the date of his arrest on July 25, 2018. Ruslan was also sentenced to 10 years in jail and two strokes of the rotan for each of the physical sexual assault charges, ordered to run concurrently, which means he will only serve 10 years in jail. However, the imprisonment term will only commence after Ruslan completed serving the 20 years jail term for the rape offence. He lost his appeal against his sentence in the High Court which was dismissed on January 22, 2020. According to the facts of the case, the victim was staying with her mother in a rented room at the house where Ruslan was also renting a room. A lawyer from the National Legal Aid Foundation, P. A. Sharon, appeared for Ruslan while deputy public prosecutor Dhiya Syazwani Izyan Mohd Akhir prosecuted the case.

Its director-general Datuk Zazuli Johan said that, based on information and intelligence, his men inspected the container at the NBCT at 9am, and arrested a 48-year-old man, a shipping agent. “Upon inspection, we found it was filled with 20 silent compressors units, with 14 of them having been modified to stash packages containing ecstasy pills of various colours. The container was brought in from Europe. “The pills weighed 1,063.206kg and the market value is estimated at over RM78 million. This is the biggest drug seizure this year,” he told a media conference. Zazuli said investigations are ongoing, including identifying those involved in the large-scale import of the drugs. The syndicate’s modus operandi was to hide drugs in the compressor units and, upon arrival in Malaysia, the items would be incorrectly declared to deceive the authorities. “Based on preliminary investigation, through the Customs Form 1, it was found that the contents of the container have yet to be declared,” he said, adding the suspect has been remanded for seven days to assist in investigations under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-member panel comprising Justices Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, Datuk Che Mohd Ruzima Ghazali and Datuk See Mee Chun, will also decide on the same day over the prosecution’s appeal against the acquittal of another teenager for the offence without ordering him to enter his defence. Justice Datuk Abu Bakar Jais, who chaired the panel, said they are not prepared to deliver the decision today as they need to go through the oral and written submission by the prosecution and the defence. Earlier, the court heard the submission by deputy public prosecutor How May Ling and lawyer Haijan Omar over the prosecution’s appeal against the High Court’s decision to acquitting and discharging the second teenager, aged 22, for the offence without calling for his defence. The appeal by the first teenager against the High Court’s decision on August 17, 2020, which found him guilty and ordered him to be detained at the pleasure of the Yang-di-Pertuan Agong, was heard on March 9 this year. According to the charge, both teenagers, who were 16 years old then, together with another unidentified individual, were accused of murdering and causing the death of the 23 people staying at the tahfiz centre at Jalan Keramat Hujung, Kampung Datuk Keramat, Wangsa Maju here, between 4.15am and 6.45am on September 14, 2017. In today’s court proceeding, How urged the court to make an order for the second teenager to enter his defence on the charge. She said it was impossible for one person to cause the fire at the school as there were two gas tanks weighing 14kg each that were carried from the ground floor of the school to the second floor through the staircase. One gas tank was placed horizontally at the door and another one vertically and petrol was splashed on the door and fire was lit. “It is impossible for one person (to do it), it was done by two persons,” How added. She said circumstantial evidence showed there were four individuals seen at the back of the tahfiz school — the first and second teenager and two other male individuals who are brothers — with the first teenager and another unidentified individual entering the tahfiz school by climbing the fence at the back of the tahfiz school. Based on the CCTV recordings and the body shape of the second teenager, who was small and thin, he was able to go through the small opening of the barbed wire fence to enter the school compound, compared to the two brothers, How added. Meanwhile, Haijan, representing the two appellants, said there was no positive identification that the second teenager had entered the school, adding that they cannot rule out the two brothers from entering the school. He said there was also no evidence to show that the second teenager was involved in the crime, hence, no need for him to enter his defence. — Bernama ',\n",

Earlier, lawyer Datuk Seri Jahaberdeen Mohamed Yunoos, representing the brothers, said they made an application so that his clients can be discharged and acquitted of all charges. Deputy Public Prosecutor Rasyidah Murni Adzmi said she had no objection to the application after examining all the documents from the applicants and both of them had paid their compounds. On June 20, 2022, the two brothers were given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) by the Sessions Court here on all charges. Mohd Farid and his brother then filed an application in the High Court for the discharge and acquittal of all charges. According to the first to 52nd charges, Mohd Farid was accused of providing a document, namely the statement of claims for payment of financial assistance to pure palm cooking oil refinery/packaging factories containing false material details for the period between January 2019 and March 2020 amounting to a total of RM1,596,341.40, to three employees of the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP). The claims contained false material details, namely information on the sale of cooking oil to retail companies, although the accused knew the sale was not actually made.

He ordered Mohd Hisham to begin his jail sentence from the date of his arrest on June 24, 2013. He told Mohd Hisham that he should consider himself very lucky as he had been spared the death sentence. Mohd Hisham, who has three wives and five children, was found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court on February 22, 2019, for killing the child in a room at the Commonwealth Forest Park & Resort, KM23, Jalan Kuala Lumpur-Rawang, Selangor between 2pm on May 9, 2013, and 4.30am on June 2, 2013. The facts of the case revealed that the child’s mother, a divorcee, had befriended Mohd Hisham through the social media platform. The woman has another child who was four years old in 2013. The boy’s mother gave evidence in the High Court that during a stay in the hotel, Mohd Hisyam did not like her having a bath with the boy together as he said it was against Islamic religious teachings and he took over that duty. The mother testified that she heard her son crying when Mohd Hisham bathed him in the bathroom, which was locked. She also said Mohd Hisham had soaked her son in a pail filled with water and ice and left him alone all night in the bathroom. She said his reason for doing so was to get rid of evil spirits in the child’s body. The mother said that on June 2, 2013, she saw Mohd Hisham giving cardiopulmonary resuscitation to her son, who was lying motionless. Later that day, the woman, her daughter and Mohd Hisham took the body in a car for burial in a jungle at Bukit Brinchang, Cameron Highlands. The mother lodged a police report about her son’s death after she and her daughter escaped from the hotel room when Mohd Hisham went shopping. Mohd Hisham was subsequently arrested and led police to the boy’s body. Lawyers Badrul Hisham Sani and Low Wei Loke represented Mohd Hisham. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, May 3 — The Sessions Court here today sentenced Rumah Bonda founder Siti Bainun Ahd Razali to a total of 22 years in prison after finding her guilty of neglecting and abusing a teenage girl with Down syndrome, known as Bella. Judge Izralizam Sanusi sentenced her to 10 years in prison for the offence of neglecting the girl and 12 years in prison for the second charge of abusing her. However, the court ordered her to serve the sentences concurrently from today, meaning she will be serving only 12 years in jail. The court also ordered the woman to sign a five-year good behaviour bond, with a local as a guarantor and a surety of RM5,000. Siti Bainun, who arrived at the court complex at 8.27am and accompanied by a woman, was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service to be completed within six months serving her time in jail. According to the charges, Siti Bainun was alleged to have neglected and abused a 13-year-old Down syndrome girl causing the victim to suffer physical and emotional injuries in a condominium unit in Wangsa Maju between February and June 2021. The charge, framed under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001, provides imprisonment for up to 20 years or a fine of RM50,000 or both, upon conviction. Izralizam, in his judgment, said the act of neglect and abuse is a serious offence and as submitted by the prosecution, Parliament had approved the amendment to the criminal punishment by imposing a heavier punishment. He said the previous 10-year prison sentence had been increased to 20 years, while the fine had been increased from RM10,000 to RM50,000. “The amendment shows the intention of Parliament and the law is to ensure that severe punishment is given to offenders who commit the offence. “The punishment that is handed down needs to reflect the seriousness of the offence committed and show the public, especially parents, guardians and babysitters, not to take the safety and welfare of children lightly,” Izralizam added. He said the public interest factor also needed to be emphasised and in this case, the court found that Bella’s injury was a serious one that left a scar on her. “It not only left a scar in her but also physically. She was not only neglected by the accused to the extent that she suffered serious injuries but the accused was also found to be involved in abusing Bella. “The accused’s actions towards Bella are cruel and she needs to be given a severe punishment to teach a lesson not only to the accused but also to the community that this kind of crime should not be condoned. “The accused is a social activist who is often involved with children. The accused should have shouldered the responsibility as best as possible and not violate the trust given,” said the judge. Earlier during mitigation, Siti Bainun’s lawyer, Mohammad Farhan Maaruf, requested for a lighter sentence on the grounds that his client could change and should be given a second chance. “If a long prison sentence is imposed on the accused, it will prejudice the mothers who depend on her. The facilities in the prison also cannot accommodate the physical condition of the accused because of her large size and health problems,” he said. Mohammad Farhan requested the court to replace the prison sentence with the maximum fine for both charges against his client. “Throughout the trial, the accused has shown that she is a responsible person in which she has never failed to appear in court because of unreasonable reasons. “I also request the court to take into account that the accused is active in charity and volunteer work, besides considering that this is the accused’s first offence,” he said. Meanwhile, deputy public prosecutor Zahida Zakaria said the accused had been convicted of a very serious offence of neglecting and abusing a child with disabilities. “A vulnerable and helpless child needs society and the law to protect their interests. The punishment must reflect the seriousness and gravity of the offence as a lesson to the public, especially parents, not to take children’s safety for granted,” he said. Zahida said the injuries suffered by Bella were serious with almost all of her body having burn scars, with some to remain for life. “It not only invites physical injury but also affects the victim’s emotions. The accused has been given a court order to care and look after Bella but she has abused the trust given to her by neglecting and ill-treating Bella,” she said. Meanwhile, Izralizam dismissed Siti Bainun’s application for a stay of the execution of the prison sentence pending her appeal at the High Court. The judge said Siti Bainun could not show special and exceptional circumstances for the court to allow a stay of the execution of her prison sentence. “The accused was found guilty in this court and there is no reason for me to suspend the prison sentence imposed on her. The factor that she is taking care of her mother is a personal matter. “The filing of an appeal by the defence attorney is not a justification to allow the application by the accused. In this case, justice can best be served through the immediate execution of the sentence. “Therefore, the accused’s application (for stay) is dismissed and the court ordered her to serve the prison sentence immediately,” he said. Siti Bainun, who appeared calm throughout the proceedings, will be sent to Kajang Prison to serve the sentence. — Bernama   ',\n",

Thanes Nair, was found unconscious in the adult swimming pool on April 17. “Only when my son was at the Chemor Health Clinic was I contacted and told that my son had fallen, but I wasn’t told that my child had actually fallen into a swimming pool,” she told the media when met today, claiming she did not know about the next door premises having a swimming pool. Explaining what occurred on that day, which also happened to be her son’s first day attending a trial class at the kindergarten, Nilaveni said her son was then sent to the Raja Permaisuri Bainun Hospital (HRPB), but claimed that he was already in a critical condition. Her son died at 10.30 am today — six days after the incident. “I am very disappointed because my son was not immediately sent by ambulance for treatment and the kindergarten failed to monitor and take care of my son, who was only four years old, when he was on their premises. How did my son, who was supposed to be under supervision, get to the swimming pool area?” she said. Thanes Nair is the only child of Nilaveni and her husband V. Vijay, 43. “I do not want other children to suffer the same fate as my child. As such, I want the authorities to investigate what actually happened to my son on that fateful day,” she said, adding that they lodged the report a day after the incident (April 18). A spokesman from the Ipoh District police headquarters, when contacted, confirmed receiving the report. Meanwhile, Kinder Labz said in a statement today that the management and its staff are working closely with the authorities. “We can confirm that Thanes was attending a trial class at our school when the tragedy took place at about 10 am on the day of the incident. “The management and staff at Kinder Labz are working closely with the authorities and have given our statements and provided all existing evidence, including CCTV (closed-circuit television) footage to (the) said authorities to facilitate investigations into the matter,” it said.

However, the complainant agreed to allow the victim’s mother to place her child there on trial for two hours,” Yahaya said.

This morning, police received information regarding the boy’s death from the hospital authorities. “The cause of death is said to be severe hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy secondary to drowning with multiorgan failure,” he said, adding the case has been classified under Section 31(1)(a) of the Child Act 2001. — Bernama ',\n",

Melaka Tengah district police chief, ACP Christopher Patit, said in the 8pm incident, the victim, a 61-year-old military veteran, suffered injuries to his left ear and right hand, due to being hit with a hollowed bamboo stick, and was treated at Melaka Hospital. Before the incident, the victim went to the lemang stall to exchange lemang which he had bought in the morning because it was found to be not properly cooked. “Upon arriving at the stall, the victim claimed that he had shown the uncooked lemang he bought to the 40-year-old seller, but the latter refused to look at it. “The lemang seller then split open one of the lemang bought by the complainant, and showed that the lemang was fully cooked before a verbal fight ensued between them which led to the alleged assault,” he said in a statement here today. Patit said during the incident, the lemang seller also hit the victim with a bamboo stick on the left ear and right hand. The initial investigation found that the incident occurred as the suspect claimed that the victim threw the uncooked lemang at him, making him angry. He claimed that the victim also wanted to upload a video of the incident, which was recorded so that people would not come to his stall. The suspect was then arrested at Jalan Kota at about 12.15am on Saturday (April 22), but was released on police bail after his statement was recorded. Patit said the investigation is ongoing, and the investigation papers will be referred to the Deputy Public Prosecutor for further action.

Justice Datuk Hadhariah Syed Ismail, who chaired a three-member panel said they need a month’s time to go through relevant laws to consider the appropriate punishment for the male teenager. Justice Hadhariah together with Justices Datuk M. Gunalan and Datuk Lim Chong Fong heard the 18-year-old teenager’s appeal today against two magistrate’s court’s order that he be sent to Henry Gurney school for three years. The boy, who was 15 years old at the time of committing the offence, was charged at the Sepang Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court for Children for two counts of physical sexual assault and another charge of carnal intercourse against the order of nature. He was also charged at the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court, sitting as a Court of Children, on a physical sexual assault charge. Two victims were his friends and one was his younger sister. On September 23, 2020, the Sepang Magistrate’s Court ordered the teenager to be placed in Henry Gurney School for three years while the Petaling Jaya Magistrate’s Court made the same order on February 4, 2021, after the teenager pleaded guilty to all of the charges. His appeal against the sentence was dismissed by the High Court on November 5, 2021. Earlier in the court proceedings, Justice Hadhariah said the panel members had read the appeal records and had noted that the appellant (the teenager) had the tendency to watch pornography. Meanwhile, the teenager’s lawyer Mohd Khairul Azam Abdul Aziz argued that the magistrate had erred in issuing the order to send his client to Henry Gurney school as there was no such recommendation from the probation officer to do so. Mohd Khairul said under Section 91 (1) of the Child Act 2001, the court can give a non-custodial sentence like a bound over, make a probation order, community service or an order for the teenager to pay a fine, compensation or costs. He said the teenager has turn a new leaf and had completed his SPM examination. He said while studying at a boarding school, there were no complaints or reports of him repeating such offences. Deputy public prosecutor Ng Siew Wee submitted that the teenager should be placed in Henry Gurney school and not be given a non-custodial sentence as the teenager has no regard for female modesty. She said a deterrent sentence should be imposed to send a message that the court shows abhorrence to those types of offences. Ng said the order of both magistrate’s courts to send the teenager to Henry Gurney School in Melaka was in accordance with the law, adding that the law allowed the teenager to be placed in the school until he turns 21. “The school, which is under the purview of the Director-General of Prisons is appropriate as it provided rehabilitation programmes,” she said adding that if the court did not agree with her that the teenager should be placed in the school, then the suitable sentence would be to commit him to a custodial sentence in prison. Ng said under the law, a probation order cannot be granted to the child if the offence committed were sexual offences. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, April 19 — The Immigration Department has busted a syndicate which used Malaysian international passports to smuggle Sri Lankan children to Europe, following the arrest of a local married couple. Immigration Director-General Datuk Ruslin Jusoh said the couple was nabbed on Wednesday (April 12) when they turned up at the Kuala Lumpur Immigration headquarters to get a Malaysian passport for a Sri Lankan child. He said the Bahnu Internationals syndicate made use of poor Malaysian parents with children under 12 to get the passports. The syndicate would trick parents into bringing their child’s birth certificate to the immigration office on the pretext of wanting to make a passport for the kid. “However, during the application process at the immigration counter, a Sri Lankan almost the same age as the Malaysian child would be ushered to the counter instead to get their fingerprint and photograph taken. “Once completed, the husband and wife, who are the syndicate’s masterminds, would act as a ‘transporter’ by bringing the Sri Lankan child with a Malaysian passport to Europe,” Ruslin said in a statement today. The Immigration officer processing the passport application that day suspected something amiss when the guardian looked significantly different from the child, who could not speak Malay. He said it was learnt that the parents were paid RM500 for bringing their child to the Immigration office. Ruslin said initial investigations showed the syndicate received 30,000 to 50,000 euros for each Sri Lankan child taken to Europe on Malaysian passports. “Investigations are ongoing to find out how long this syndicate has been active and how many children were involved. “The couple, aged 37 and 26, were charged under Section 26A of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act (ATIPSOM) 2007 in the Sessions Court here today. “The Immigration Department would like to advise the public not to be easily manipulated by offers and lies from such syndicates. “Anyone with doubts on immigration matters can refer to the department or obtain the latest information through its website and official social media accounts,” he said. — Bernama ',\n",

The accused then sold them and the sale proceeds were used to buy food and drugs.

He was sentenced to 18 years in jail and 10 strokes of the cane for the first offence of raping the girl, and eight years in jail and one stroke of the cane for sexually assaulting her, and an additional two years imprisonment and two strokes of the cane because he is in a relationship of trust with the victim.

According to the first charge, the man was charged with raping the girl, who was then 11 years old, in a bedroom at their house in Jempol near here, at 12.01 midnight between December 20 and 31, 2017.

Penang police chief Datuk Mohd Shuhaily Mohd Zain said the suspects, aged between 21 and 45, were nabbed during five separate raids in the two states after one month of surveillance and intelligence. “The first arrest involved a foreigner working as a construction worker at Juru Autocity at 6pm on Wednesday (March 29). A check on the car he was in found five blocks of black plastic containing 178 packets of syabu. “All the drugs are to be transported to a neighbouring country by sea route using fishing boats. This is the largest seizure involving syabu this year,” he told a press conference today. Following the arrest, police raided three more locations in Penang and detained four foreigners, who are also construction workers and fishermen and seized a fibre boat with two engines worth RM380,000. Mohd Shuhaily said police also raided a house in Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur at 4am yesterday and picked up a local man, and seized cash totalling RM500,000. He said seven vehicles, including Porsche Panamera, Toyota Alphard and Mercedes-Benz, worth RM1.381 million were also seized. “Investigation revealed that the syndicate had been active since the middle of last year. They will transport syabu packed in Chinese tea packets from Kuala Lumpur to Penang before sending them to a neighbouring country. “All suspects tested negative for drugs and two of them had previous criminal and drug records,” Mohd Shuhaily said, adding that further investigations are underway to track the network. The suspects have been remanded for seven days until April 5 to assist in the investigation under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952. — Bernama   ',\n",

The smell actually came from the carcasses placed in a white box in front of the suspect’s house,” she said. Halijah said that after the incident, the management together with the owner of the house filed a police report. Meanwhile, another neighbour who only wanted to be known as Din said that there were many stray cats in the condominium area, but lately the number had been decreasing. “Residents are not allowed to keep pets, but based on my observation there are many residents who do not follow the rules,” he said.

Johor police chief Datuk Kamarul Zaman Mamat said a day before the incident, a man in his 30s with several criminal records was shot dead at Taman Melodies here. “An investigation is underway to find out the motive of the murder. The next day (March 21), during the wake for the deceased, a group of 20 individuals came and caused a ruckus at the funeral home, so efforts to trace them are underway,” he said at the Johor Police Contingent headquarters (IPK), earlier today. The case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder and Section 148 of the Penal Code for rioting. Asked if the killing was related to the murder case of a man at a petrol station in Taman Pelangi here in 2017, Kamarul Zaman said police are investigating the allegation. On December 17, 2017, a man in his 30s was reportedly stabbed to death and hit by a car driven by four men at a petrol station in Taman Pelangi at 7.30pm. A foreign woman, in her 20s and believed to be his wife, was with the victim at that time. In a separate case, he said police and the Johor State Islamic Religious Department (JAINJ) are hunting for six members of the Suhaini Muhammad or Sihulk heretical group, aged in their 20s to 30s after they allegedly insulted Islam and the Prophet Muhammad in a TikTok video recently. “Regarding the viral video of heresy, the six individuals involved have been identified and action will be taken by the Bukit Aman Classified Crime Investigation Unit. “My advice is they had better surrender to the police, instead of letting the police come to them,” Kamarul Zaman said, adding the faces of the perpetrators were clearly visible in the video. On Tuesday (March 21), state Islamic Religious Affairs Committee chairman Mohd Fared Mohd Khalid was reported to have said that JAINJ and police were tracking down members of the heretical Sihulk group. — Bernama ',\n",

He advised the public not to download any unauthorised or suspicious applications or links and to carry out checks at https://semakmule.rmp.gov.my, before making any transactions to avoid being scammed. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Zulhazmi Abdullah meted out the punishment on Lloyd George Bedwell, 48, and Roger Hoi Wing Wu, 46, after they pleaded guilty to two selected charges read to them in English and ordered the two to serve their prison sentence from the day of their arrest on February 21. Both accused with another man still at-large, Jacob Yazdi allegedly duped two Austrians, Trevor Ronald John Curtis and Kimberley John Buist Walker, to hand over AU$8,991.92 (RM27,057.36) and AU$8,573 (RM25,796.80) with the assurance of receiving big profits from short-term investment via the purchase of shares of a non-existent company, Devon Energy Corporation. They allegedly committed the scam at Lot 7, Fourth Floor, Island Plaza Tower, Jalan Tanjung Tokong, Penang on Dec 16, 2022, and on Jan 5 and were charged under Section 417 of the Penal Code read together with Section 34 of the same code which provides for a maximum jail term of five years or fine or both upon conviction. According to the facts of the case, Yazdi who was the manager ordered the syndicate employees under his supervision who were the two accused to make phone calls to the victims. The prosecution was conducted by Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy public prosecutors Ahmad Akram Gharib, Noor Azura Zulkifli and Afiqa Liyana Rozman while the accused were represented by counsels V. Muniandy and A. Ashok.

       "   'cf1:content': 'SHAH ALAM, March 16 — Two United Kingdom men were sentenced to six months in prison by the Sessions Court, here today after pleading guilty to charges of involvement in an international online investment fraud syndicate. Judge Rozilah Salleh also fined Andrew Mark Peters, 55, RM180,000 or 22 months in prison and Darren Anthony McNicholas, 51, was fined RM140,000 or 16 months in jail. Andrew was charged with two counts of being the mastermind of an international fraud syndicate who instructed Darren under the pseudonyms ‘David Henshaw’ and ‘Henry Paxton’ to deceive a Scottish citizen with guaranteed high profits from a short-term investment by purchasing shares in two non-existent companies. The charges were framed under Section 109 of the Penal Code read with Section 417 of the same code which provides for imprisonment of up to five years or a fine or both. Darren also faced two charges of cheating the same individual in relation to a similar offence under Section 417. The actions of the two accused prompted the victim to hand over US$5,672.41 (RM25,433.67) and €121,200 (RM576,221) into two bank accounts belonging to a company which the victim would not have done if he had not been deceived. They allegedly committed the act in a unit of a building in Petaling Jaya, from May 21 to June 27, 2019. Earlier, lawyer Muhammad Rafique Rashid Ali who represented the two accused asked for a minimum sentence on the grounds that they were first offenders and had no previous record in their country of origin and Malaysia and provided good cooperation throughout the investigation. “Andrew has health issues and needs medical care for his bowels. He also has difficulties moving around and needs assistance with a wheelchair. For Darren, he has a wife who is Malaysian and a child. The sentence will affect his Malaysian family. “The admission of guilt by them saves cost and time for the court and the prosecution, besides they express regrets and apologise for the offences,” he said. Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) deputy public prosecutor Mohamad Fadhly Mohd Zamry asked for a sentence commensurate with the crime of two accused taking into account the public interest over their own interests. He said a sentence that is too low would send a message to Malaysians that the court did not take the offence seriously. “We have to take into account the frequency and the proliferation of fraud cases not only in Malaysia but all over the world. According to the facts of the case, the international fraud syndicate was based in Malaysia since 2015. There should be appropriate punishment so that the accused does not repeat the offence,” he said. The prosecution was also handled by MACC deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib. Previously, five British nationals and two Filipino nationals were among the 10 individuals arrested by MACC in raids in Kuala Lumpur and Penang on February 21 related to an international investment fraud syndicate that also involved money laundering and corrupt practices. They were arrested in an operation called Op Tropicana led by MACC’s Anti-Money Laundering Division, which raided 24 locations around Kuala Lumpur and Penang including three syndicate call centres, two located in Kuala Lumpur and one in Penang. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, March 15 — A housewife was sentenced by the Court of Appeal here today to one year in jail for trafficking two foreign maids and exploiting them by making them work in her house-cleaning business without paying them. This was after Chong Chon Lang, 60, lost her appeal to set aside her conviction for the offence. However, the Court of Appeal bench comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk See Mee Chun and Datuk Azman Abdullah allowed Chong’s appeal to reduce her jail sentence from 12 years imprisonment to 12 months jail term. She said the 12 years imprisonment term meted out by the Sessions Court on Chong was manifestly excessive and the court also take into account of her age. Meanwhile, the court acquitted and discharged her husband Low Kee Pat, 62, of the same charges after ruling that he was not involved in the exploitation of the women who were Indonesian and Cambodian nationals. As for Chong, Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court’s decision, said the overall evidence showed that she (Chong) made use of her two maids to provide cleaning services to other people’s houses without paying them. On January 10, 2019, the Sessions Court found the couple guilty of exploiting a Cambodian woman, then aged 28, at a house in Taman Rawang Perdana, Rawang between May 13, 2010, and July 14, 2016, and the Indonesian maid, who was 30 years old then, in the same house between March 2015 and July 14, 2016. Both Chong and Low, a former contractor, were sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for each charge to run concurrently. They appealed to the High Court but they lost their appeal which was dismissed on May 29, 2020. In today’s proceeding, the couple’s lawyer Sreekant Pillai argued that the prosecution failed to prove the exploitation charges. He said his clients went through an agent to get the maids to work for them as domestic maids legally, adding that they were treated well and were paid salaries. Sreekant added that if the two maids were brought to clean just one or two other houses, it did not fall within the definition of exploitation and forced labour under Section 2 of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act (ATIPSOM) 2007. He said the charges against his clients should not be under ATIPSOM but under the Immigration Act or under the Penal Code where the punishment is lower. Deputy public prosecutor Aznee Salmie Ahmad said under the terms of employment, the two women were only supposed to work at the couple’s house but instead, they were forced to clean other houses. She said the wife collected the money for the cleaning services and the maids did not receive any payment for the work. — Bernama ',\n",

According to a MACC source, the four men aged between 40 and 55 were arrested late yesterday afternoon at MACC headquarters here. Three of them were remanded for three days until March 17 after Magistrate Irza Zulaikha Rohanuddin granted the MACC’s application at Putrajaya Magistrate’s Court today, while the other was released on MACC bail. According to the MACC source, the sukuk was managed by a local bank to finance the project. All the expenses and earnings of the project had to be put into a designated special account, but the special account was later changed to another account which was believed to have been deliberately created in early 2022, suspected of avoiding repayment of the principal and profits to sukuk holders. The source said the act of creating another account would cause a loss of millions of ringgit to sukuk holders. It is understood that the concession agreement between the government and the appointed company for the implementation of the project was signed in July 2011 for a period of 12 years, and the sukuk is expected to reach maturity in May 2023. MACC chief commissioner Tan Sri Azam Baki when contacted confirmed the arrest but refused to comment further.

Judge Datuk Ahmad Bache fixed the date after listening to submissions from lawyer S. Devanandan representing Peter as the appellant and deputy public prosecutor Datuk Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin. Earlier Devanandan argued that the letter regarding the M&E System maintenance and service contract at UMS was signed by the eighth prosecution witness (SP8), UMS deputy vice-chancellor (Academic & International) Prof Shariff Abdul Kadir S. Omang and not the appellant. “SP8 in his testimony confirmed that he signed the letter on behalf of UMS vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Mohamad Harun Abdullah (SP1), but SP1 in his testimony said that he had never authorised SP8 to sign the letter. “As such, the appellant is not involved in this matter and I request that the appellant’s appeal to set aside his conviction and sentence be allowed by the court,” he said. Wan Shaharuddin meanwhile, argued that the trial judge had examined that there was circumstantial evidence in convicting the accused, namely, who stands to gain if the maintenance project was awarded to any party and who had the opportunity to forge letters related to the project. “The trial judge found that the element of forgery was completed when the letter was handed over to the late Datuk Azlin Alias who was then principal private secretary to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak. “This shows that the appellant (Peter) is the ‘maker’ of the letter and not SP8,” he said. According to Wan Shaharuddin, the appellant knew that the project was offered through an open tender but he had cheated and intended to hijack the project. “When defending himself, the accused himself admitted that it is a common practice to hijack projects in this country, even though they are offered through an open tender. This is very sad and as such, the prosecution urges the court reject the appellant’s appeal and uphold the conviction and sentence against him,” said Wan Shaharuddin. In June last year, Peter, 52, filed an appeal against the prison sentence and fine handed down by Sessions Court Judge Azura Alwi on May 26, 2022, after finding him guilty of the charge. Peter, as the managing director of Syarikat Asli Jati Sdn Bhd, was charged with falsifying a letter from the office of UMS deputy vice-chancellor dated June 9, 2014, which included false statements with the intention to deceive. The offence committed in the office of the principal private secretary to the prime minister at Perdana Putra building, Putrajaya between June 13 and Aug 21, 2014, was framed under Section 468 of the Penal Code which provides for a maximum prison sentence of seven years and a fine. The Parti Kesejahteraan Demokratik Malaysia (KDM) chief has paid the RM50,000 fine. — Bernama ',\n",

This was after a three-member bench comprising Justices Datuk Hanipah Farikullah, Datuk See Mee Chun and Datuk Azman Abdullah dismissed the prosecution’s appeal to set aside a High Court’s decision which had acquitted and discharged Mohd Asrul Hisyam Setapa. Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court’s decision, held that there was no merits in the prosecution’s appeal. The prosecution had sought to restore the Sessions Court’s decision which had convicted and sentenced Mohd Arul to six years in jail and fined a total of RM236,000. Hanipah said that there was doubt regarding the type of burden of proof that the Sessions Court judge applied to convict Mohd Asrul, 36, on the charges. She said the Sessions Court judge also failed to state when the statutory presumption under Section 50 of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Act (MACC) 2009 was invoked against Mohd Asrul. Section 50 states that for anyone who faces charges under the MACC Act, it is proved that any gratification that has been received or given by or to the accused, the gratification shall be presumed to have been corruptly received or given unless the contrary is proven. Justice Hanipah said the Sessions Court’s decision to convict Mohd Asrul on the charges was bad in law. On July 30, 2018, the Sessions Court sentenced Mohd Asrul to six years in jail and fined him a total of RM236,000 after finding him guilty of the charges. On December 21, 2020, the High Court acquitted and discharged Mohd Asrul after allowing his appeal. Mohd Asrul was charged with allegedly accepting bribes in the form of goods and cash, totalling RM40,248.03, at several locations in Kota Bahru, Kelantan between April 4, 2016, and August 22, 2016.

JPJ, in a statement today, said the Kuantan-based company was caught committing the offence in Putrajaya and Pahang during the nationwide Ops e-Hailing to weed out EHO operations which allowed unregistered vehicles and those without EVP to operate.

Certain documents of the company and equipment like computer, advertising boards, banners and bunting were also confiscated and sealed for the purpose of investigation under Section 222 of APAD 2010, it said. According to JPJ, companies which allow e-Hailing vehicles to operate without an EVP can be prosecuted under Section 12A(9) of APAD 2010, which provides for a fine of between RM1,000 and RM500,000, or jail of up to two years. “Companies wishing to carry out the business of e-Hailing and provision of EHO system to e-Hailing vehicle drivers must be registered and licensed under APAD or the Commercial Vehicles Licensing Board (LPKP),” it said.

       "   'cf1:content': 'PETALING JAYA, March 2 — A former senior military officer was fined RM6,000, in default five months in jail by the Magistrate’s Court here today for seducing a married woman seven years ago. Magistrate Zhafran Rahim Hamzah handed down the sentence to Azmi Ali, 48 after he pleaded guilty to the charge. Azmi pleaded guilty to one count of criminal intent in seducing a 44-year-old woman into having intercourse at a house in Bandar Putra Permai, Seri Kembangan, here, in early 2016. The offence was framed under Section 498 of the Penal Code, which carries a maximum jail sentence of two years, or a fine, or both. During the mitigation, lawyer Azman Zakaria, representing the accused, appealed to the court to order a good behaviour bond under Section 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code, on the grounds his client had repented. “If Section 294 is not applied, I request a fine as this is my client’s first offence and he has no previous convictions. “Since this case, he was advised to be discharged from the Malaysian Armed Forces (MAF) after serving for 28 years. My client is married and works as a security guard with an income of RM4,500 and takes care of his parents,” he said. However, deputy public prosecutor Siti Maryam Jamilah Md Kamal objected to the application and requested that the court ordered a deterrent sentence that would serve as a lesson to the accused and the public. “The woman’s now ex-husband suffered depression following the discovery of the relationship and that he is still undergoing treatment. His business went bankrupt due to his inability to stay focused,” she said. — Bernama ',\n",

A three-member bench led by Judge Datuk Hanipah Farikullah unanimously rejected the appeal by Hazmi Majid, 41, as the trial judge did not make any error in fact and law to find the appellant guilty of the charge. “The injuries inflicted on the baby are sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. “We find the verdict of the (High Court) judge to be safe based on the entire evidence. As such, the appeal is dismissed and the conviction upheld,” said Justice Hanipah, who sat with Justices Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk See Mee Chun. Hazmi was found guilty of the offence by the Shah Alam High Court on August 20, 2021. Hazmi, who is the husband of the victim’s babysitter, was charged with killing and causing the death of Nur Muazara Ulfa Mohammad Zainal or Zara at a unit in Sri Cempaka Apartment, Jalan 6/3, Section 16, Bandar Baru Bangi, between 10.30am and 1.30pm, on November 7, 2018. The charge, under Section 302 of the Penal Code, provides for the death penalty. Earlier today, lawyer T. Vijayandran, who represented the appellant, submitted that the trial judge failed to make an express finding as to whether the fatal injury found on the victim’s body was intentionally inflicted by the appellant. “Prosecution witness (PW5) and pathologist Dr Emizam Mohamadon had testified that the cause of death was due to blunt impact to the head and described the said injury as serious and likely to result in death. “The prosecution did not prove a higher mens rea (intention of knowledge) that the act amounted to murder,” said the lawyer. Deputy public prosecutor Parvin Hameedah Mohd Khaja submitted that the trial judge made a finding of guilt after evaluating all evidence by prosecution witnesses as against the defence. “The pathologist testified that the injuries were new and had happened within three days. He also explained that the injuries were not self-inflicted and could not be caused by a fall. “We also submit that the evidence of the pathologist clearly shows that the injuries brought onto the victim baby were extremely serious and were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. “The High Court judge did not make any error in fact and law in finding the appellant guilty,” said Parvin Hameedah, who was assisted by Khairul Aisamuddin Abdul Rahman. — Bernama ',\n",

Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin made the ruling after finding that the prosecution had succeeded in establishing a prima facie case against Ismahalil, 49, at the end of the prosecution case. Muhammad Jamil, in his summary judgment, said the court found that the 22 packets of drugs found in Ismahalil’s room were in his control and custody. “During the raid, the accused himself picked up the bag containing the drugs and gave it to the police officer after being asked if there was any contraband inside. “The behaviour of the accused, in picking up the bag himself was seen to be suspicious, showing that he knew the presence of the drug. Therefore, the prosecution succeeded in proving that the drug was under the control of the accused. “Therefore, the argument by the defence that his client does not have the knowledge, control and custody of the drug has no merit,” he said, adding that the testimony by the prosecution witnesses was not contradictory and was reliable. When told by the judge of the option for him to make his defence, Ismahalil chose to testify under oath from the witness stand, with the prosecution given the opportunity to question him during cross-examination. After the court gave its verdict, Ismahalil was seen sobbing, while looking at his wife and children who were in the public gallery. His lawyer, Datuk Ahmad Zaharil Muhaiyar, then told the court that the defence will call five witnesses, including the accused. The court has set May 30 and May 31 for the defence trial.

The sources said they were arrested during Op Tropicana yesterday, when the MACC’s Anti-Money Laundering Division raided 24 locations in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. The syndicate, led by its British masterminds, was said to have been operating since 2019 and was also involved in money-laundering activities and corruption.

The suspects, aged between 39 and 59, had been remanded for six days on an order issued by Magistrate Mohd Dinie Shazwan Ab Shukor in Putrajaya today, the sources said. The suspects, handcuffed and dressed in MACC’s orange lock-up attire, were taken to the Putrajaya Magistrate’s Court at 2.23 pm under escort by the Immigration Department’s Special Tactical Team (Pastak).

Adam Radlan, 42, who is Segambut Bersatu deputy division leader, pleaded not guilty to both charges before Judge Rozilah Salleh. On both charges, he was alleged to have received bribes amounting to RM4.1 million from Lian Tan Chuan and Mat Jusoh Mamat through a CIMB Bank Bhd account belonging to Bayu Bumiraya Sdn Bhd of which he is a director. The money was given as gratification to Adam for helping Nepturis Sdn Bhd and MIE Infrastructure & Energy Sdn Bhd to obtain two projects, namely the Klang Utara district head office, worth RM141 million, and the construction of Jalan Sungai Adam to Kampung Banat, Perlis, worth RM47.8 million, from the Malaysian government. Adam Radlan was charged with committing the offences at the Jaya One branch of the CIMB Bank Bhd in Petaling Jaya between November 26, 2021, and January 5, 2023. The charges were framed under Section 16(a)(A) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009, and punishable under Section 24(1) of the same law, which provides imprisonment for up to 20 years and a fine of not less than five times the value of the bribe or RM10,000, whichever is higher, if found guilty. MACC deputy public prosecutor Allan Suman Pillai requested bail at RM500,000 with two sureties on each charge and for Adam Radlan to report to the MACC office once in two months, as well as surrender his passport to the court. Lawyer Datuk Seri Rajan Navaratnam, representing Adam Radlan, requested bail be reduced to RM300,000 for both charges as his client’s account had been frozen and he was supporting four children and a mother. Following that, Rozilah set bail at RM300,000 with two sureties for each charge and also ordered Adam Radlam to report himself at the MACC office in Putrajaya once a month. The judge also told the prosecution to transfer Adam Adlan’s passport, which had been surrendered to the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court, to be kept at the Shah Alam Sessions Court, if the charges at the court in Kuala Lumpur were dropped. She also set April 14 for mention. At the Kuala Lumpur Sessions Court yesterday, Adam Radlam was charged with soliciting 3.5 per cent to seven per cent of the value of the project from Mat Jusoh, who is MIE Infrastructure & Energy Sdn Bhd managing director. The money was an inducement for him to help the company to obtain the Letter of Acceptance for a project under the Jana Wibawa Programme from the Malaysian government. He was also charged with receiving a bribe of RM500,000 which was transferred into his CIMB Bank Berhad by Mat Jusoh as gratification for helping MIE Infrastructure & Energy Sdn Bhd obtained the Letter of Acceptance for a project involving road construction from Jalan Sungai Adam to Kampung Banat, in Perlis, which was worth RM47,8000,000, from the Malaysian government through direct negotiation. Adam Radlan was charged before Judge Suzana Hussin, who then allowed him bail of RM120,000 with two sureties and an additional condition to surrender his passport to the court, as well as report himself to the MACC office once a month. Prior to this, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was reported to have said that the implementation of the Jana Wibawa project was postponed for a review of whether its procurement procedure was made in compliance with the rules set by the Treasury. According to Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who is also Minister of Rural and Regional Development, the project, valued at RM5.7 billion, was postponed as there were elements of selective tender or direct negotiation in the procurement process. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'SEPANG, Feb 19 — Several individuals from two employment agencies in the country believed to be involved in recruiting Malaysians to work abroad have been arrested for their involvement in a job scam. Bukit Aman CID director Datuk Seri Abdul Jalil Hassan said the arrests were made last month and they are now being investigated by the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants (ATIPSOM). “These companies have licences to bring in foreign workers to work in Malaysia as domestic workers, construction labourers and farm workers. “However, they were found to have exploited their licence and exported Malaysians to work abroad such as Thailand and Myanmar until they were stranded there,” he said. He told reporters in a press conference following the return of five Malaysians who were victims of a job scam syndicate in Thailand, at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport here today. “Police will work with the Labour and Immigration Departments to find the masterminds of the syndicate. I believe these masterminds are in both countries (Malaysia and Thailand) and they are working together,” he said. Meanwhile, he reminded non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the next of kin of the victims to channel information to the Royal Malaysia Police (RMN) or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that the information from Malaysia to the Thai authorities is only through one official channel. “The issue of overlapping information is the biggest obstacle facing the Thai authorities. When we channel information to them, they are unsure whether they want to receive information from NGOs or RMN. The thing (information) is not synchronised. “So, we have decided that from now on only information channelled by the embassy or police-to-police will be accepted,” he said. He also reminded local folks to think hard before accepting a job offer abroad with a decent salary. “This should be a question mark when an outside company can offer them up to US$2,000 (about RM8,800) when they have no qualifications or any work experience. Please think twice even if it is offered from a legitimate employment agency,” he said. He said with the return of the five victims, RMN and the Royal Thai Police have managed to rescue 12 victims and are currently tracking the remaining 14 victims who are still stranded there. — Bernama ',\n",

Jasmine Cheong, the lawyer representing former pathologist colonel doctor Dr R. Kunaseegaran, when contacted, said the appeal hearing date was vacated during the last case management on January 16, this year. She said this was because two of the appellants, R. Dinishwaran and S.

The court has fixed April 11 for case management for the appeal. On July 10, 2020, Kunaseegaran, money lender S. Ravi Chandaran, and four unemployed persons — Dinishwaran, A.K. Thinesh Kumar, M. Vishwanath and S. Nimalan — were sentenced to death by the High Court in Kuala Lumpur after they were found guilty for the murder of Morais. The six men were charged with murdering Morais, 55, somewhere along Jalan Dutamas Raya Sentul and No. 1, Jalan USJ 1/6D, Subang Jaya, between 7am and 8pm on September 4, 2015. Morais was reported missing on September 4, 2015. He was seen leaving his apartment at Menara Duta in Kuala Lumpur in a Proton Perdana.

Judge Datuk Azhar Abdul Hamid ruled that the five-year prison sentence meted out against Low, 60, also known as Repco Low, by the Sessions Court on February 29, 2016, was excessive. However, he upheld the RM5 million fine imposed on Low. “After examining the record of appeal and the written and oral submissions from both parties, I agree with the submissions of the respondent (prosecution) and the issues raised in this appeal. I find that the appellant’s (Low) conviction is safe. Therefore, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed,” said Judge Azhar. However, he allowed Low’s application to stay the execution of the prison sentence and fine pending an appeal at the Court of Appeal. “I allow the application for stay of the sentence and maintain the conditions of the previous bail, which is RM1.3 million bail and the passport to be handed over to the court,” Judge Azhar said. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Shoba Venu Gobal objected to the stay application by Low, represented by Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, saying that there were no special circumstances that required a stay. On February 29, 2016, Sessions Court Judge Mat Ghani Abdullah sentenced Low to five years in prison and fined him RM5 million after finding that the defence had failed to raise reasonable doubts at the end of the prosecution’s case. However, the court granted Low a stay of execution pending an appeal at the High Court, and the bail was increased from RM300,000 to RM1.3 million. In 1999, Low was charged in the Sessions Court on a charge of instructing a representative of Sime Securities Sdn Bhd to buy Repco Holdings shares by absorbing any offer price of the shares offered by stock sellers on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. The act was deemed to have created confusion about the price of the shares on KLSE. Low, from Kota Kinabalu, Sabah was charged with committing the offence at Sime Securities, Level 21, Bangunan Sime Bank, Jalan Sultan Sulaiman, Kuala Lumpur, between 11am and 5pm on December 3, 1997. He was charged under Section 84(1) of the Securities Industry Act 1983, read together with Section 88(b) of the same law, which provides a minimum fine of RM1 million and imprisonment for up to 10 years, if found guilty. On November 14, 2006, Low was acquitted of the charge by the Sessions Court without his defence being called, but the prosecution made an appeal. On October 15, 2010, the High Court dismissed the prosecution’s appeal, and the latter filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal, which then ordered Low to enter his defence at the Sessions Court. — Bernama ',\n",

For the second charge, the accused was alleged to have breached a contract by not paying the rental, amounting to RM24,000, to a company for the premises in Penang, but had allegedly utilised the money for rental payment of his premises in Kuantan, where the washing machines were placed. The offence was allegedly committed at Block A, Kelana Centrepoint, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, on January 31, 2019. Both charges were framed under Section 406 of the Penal Code which provides imprisonment for up to 10 years, whipping and a fine, if found guilty. The prosecution was conducted by deputy public prosecutor Aliff Asraf Abuar Sharuddin, while Terrence was represented by lawyer James S. Thanjong Tuan. Judge Darmafikri Abu Adam allowed Terrence bail of RM12,000 with one surety and also ordered him to surrender his passport to the court and to report himself at a police station once a month. The court set March 21 for mention. — Bernama ',\n",

       "   'cf1:content': 'PUTRAJAYA, Feb 15 — A massage parlour proprietor began his 10-year jail sentence today after the Court of Appeal here upheld his conviction for trafficking two Indonesian women and exploiting them to provide sexual services to clients. Lee Kum Loon, 58, lost his final appeal to set aside his conviction and jail sentence. A warrant of committal was issued by the three-member panel led by Justice Datuk Hanipah Farikullah for Lee to begin his jail sentence from today. He was previously released on a RM11,000 bail pending the hearing of his appeal. Justice Hanipah, who presided with Justices Datuk Wira Ahmad Nasfy Yasin and Datuk Lim Chong Fong, dismissed Lee’s appeal after ruling that his conviction for the offence was safe. Justice Hanipah, who delivered the court’s unanimous decision, said it was the court’s view there was no specific meaning to the term ‘trafficking’ in the Anti-Trafficking In Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (ATIPSOM) and the court referred to a Cambridge dictionary to get the meaning of the term ‘trafficking’. Justice Hanipah said that based on the overall evidence adduced in the court and the meaning of ‘trafficking’ in the dictionary, the court found that the element of section 2 of ATIPSOM has been fulfilled. She said according to the dictionary, the meaning of trafficking is an act of buying or selling people or of making money from work they are forced to do such as sex work. According to the charge, Lee committed the offence on the women, then aged 24 and 28, at Asia City Reflexology in Taman Perindustrian Axis, Shah Alam, Selangor at 6.15pm on July 31, 2018. On April 4, 2019, the Sessions Court found Lee guilty of the offence and sentenced him to seven years imprisonment. The High Court, on March 10, 2020, dismissed Lee’s appeal and increased his jail term to 10 years. This prompted him to file an appeal to the Court of Appeal. During the appeal hearing, Lee’s counsel Tan Choon Hong argued that the women were only employed to give body massage services and his client never forced them to provide sexual services. He said the women willingly offered sexual services, adding that the money for those services was given to them and that his client did not collect any money. Tan said the charge against his client under ATIPSOM was too harsh, adding that Lee could have been charged under the Penal Code or the Immigration Act. Deputy public prosecutor Fauziah Daud said the women were coerced by Lee to perform sexual acts which are considered sexual exploitation. She said the women’s willingness to perform sexual acts is not an element to be considered by the court. — Bernama ',\n",

Deputy public prosecutor Nurnajihatul Idayu Mohd Azuyar offered bail of RM4,000 for each accused, while lawyer Tan Yen Sing, representing all the accused, appealed for a lower bail on the grounds that they earned a low and irregular monthly income.

In the court’s decision, Justice Hanipah said the High Court judge was duty-bound to consider all evidence before him but in this case, he failed to comply with Section 182A of the Criminal Procedure Code for not considering the defence case which amounted to a miscarriage of justice.

Both men, who were car repossessors, were found guilty of trafficking the drug and sentenced to death by the High Court on February 27, 2020.

Judge Rozilah Salleh handed down the sentence on Mohd Shah Rizan Yasak, 43; Mohd Riduan Ibrahim, 41, and Muhamad Yusri Yusof, 36, after they pleaded guilty to an alternative charge which was read out to them separately. Mohd Shah Rizan was sentenced to five months in jail and fined RM20,000, in default six months jail, while Mohd Riduan was sentenced to four months and fined RM10,000 (in default four months jail) and three months jail for Muhamad Yusri with a fine of RM5,000 (in default three months jail). They were ordered to serve the jail sentence from today. According to the charges, the three men, who are with the Forensic Unit at the hospital, received cash amounting to RM6,250, RM3,550 and RM1,100, respectively, through online transfers in their bank accounts from a 32-year-old company owner to do work related to funeral arrangement. They were charged with committing the offence at several bank branches in Bandar Baru Bangi, Kajang and Banting, near here between March 18, 2018, and Aug 7, 2019. The charge was framed under Section 165 of the Penal Code, where they were charged, as public servants, with obtaining valuable things without consideration from a person whom they knew had a connection with their official function. Meanwhile, Rozilah, before handing down the sentence, advised the three accused to repent and not to repeat their mistakes. “As PPKs in the forensic unit who make the funeral arrangement for the dead patients, your job is a very honourable one. “Even if your earning is not much, let it be a blessed income blessed…What you did is wrong and I hope this punishment will be a lesson,” she said.

According to South Klang district police chief Cha Hoong Fong, the 31-year-old suspect was driving recklessly along the road near Kampung Pendamar Mosque and was unable to avoid oncoming traffic as he tried to squeeze between two cars that slowed down to cross a speed bump. The Proton Inspira he was driving at high speed hit the bump, causing it to jump upward and sideways and hit both cars before skidding to a stop at the side of the road. The suspect then abandoned the car and fled on foot into the surrounding village area, just seconds before an unmarked Myvi driven by his pursuers, a police team from the Selangor contingent police headquarters Criminal Investigation Department (CID), pulled up behind his car and gave chase. In a dramatic turn of events, the suspect managed to double back to where both cars were, jumped into the unmarked Myvi and tried to drive off. The police team, who was fast on his heels, then fired several gunshots to deter him from escaping or injuring bystanders, but the suspect managed to drive away in the police team’s vehicle. The suspect did not make it far as he was subsequently apprehended by the police in the vicinity of Jalan Kem, Port Klang the same day. Cha said he learnt of the incident after receiving a call from a man at around 7pm about a gunfire incident involving the two vehicles, which was also recorded by those who witnessed it and shared on social media. A South Klang police team dispatched to the area then discovered the CID team and learned about the entire chase. “The Selangor CID forensics unit has inspected the incident location and the South Klang district police headquarters has opened investigation papers under Section 307 of the Penal Code for attempted murder,” Cha said, adding that the suspect, who possessed several drug and criminal records, has been handed to the Subang Jaya police headquarters for further investigation over the robbery under Section 395/397 of the Penal Code. He added that further investigation into the incident was still ongoing and that investigation papers would be completed soon. — Bernama ',\n",

He said the ‘doctors’ were responsible for mixing powders and liquid drugs, believed to be ketamine, into drinks before other syndicate members distribute the drug-laced drinks to be sold at RM300 per bottle at other entertainment outlets in the city. “In the first operation (codenamed) ‘Devon Rex’, police arrested six local men aged between 22 and 39 and seized 21kg of ketamine valued at RM1.2 million and 2kg of syabu worth RM72,000. “Following the arrest, police conducted a second raid on Feb 8 codenamed ‘Breadnut’ and arrested the five ‘doctors’, comprising three local men, a local woman and a foreign woman, aged between 24 and 34. “In the raid, we confiscated an estimated RM340,000 worth of a variety of drugs and cigarettes containing synthetic mushrooms,” Azmi told reporters, here, today.

       "   'cf1:content': 'KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 13 — Two friends pleaded guilty in the Sessions Court here today to two charges of committing impersonation and robbery, during which they dragged their victim for a distance using a motorcycle. Muhammad Zuraidi Abdullah, 28, and Muhd Ammar Haziq Zulkifli, 27, who were both unrepresented, made the plea after the charges were read out to them before judge Hamidah Mohamed Deril. The court refused to grant them bail and set March 7 for hearing the facts of the case before sentencing. They were charged with robbing a 25-year-old man of his Apple iPhone 6 Plus and injuring him by dragging their victim with the motorcycle they were riding on. They were also charged with impersonating police officers when committing the offence in Jalan Kuchai Maju, Brickfields, at 4.30am on January 28 this year. The robbery charge under Section 394 of the Penal Code provides for imprisonment of up to 20 years and a fine or caning while the impersonation offence under Section 170 of the same law carries a sentence of up to two years jail or a fine, or both, on conviction. — Bernama ',\n",

Sepang district police chief ACP Wan Kamarul Azran Wan Yusof, in a statement today, said the three men aged between 23 and 52, were arrested in separate raids in Puchong, Selangor. In the first raid at Kampung Sri Aman in Puchong, conducted at about 8pm yesterday (February 12), the police arrested two men aged 23 and 41 and confiscated three mobile phones. The third suspect, aged 52, was arrested at about 2.30am today in Taman Puchong Prima and the police also seized a pair of trousers with blood stains. Prior to that, at about 12.05am today, the police recovered a machete from a cowshed under the Putrajaya-Cyberjaya ring road bridge. Wan Kamarul Azran said the motive for the murder was believed to be over a love triangle and that the case was being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code. The three suspects are in remand for seven days until this Sunday (February 19), he said. — Bernama ',\n",
